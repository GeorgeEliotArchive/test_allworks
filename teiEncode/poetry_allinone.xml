					<l>⁠"La noche buena se viene,</l>
					<l>La noche buena se va,</l>
					<l>⁠Y nosotros nos iremos</l>
					<l>⁠Y no volveremos mas."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>—Old Villanico.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>SWEET evenings come and go, love,</l>
					<l>They came and went of yore:</l>
					<l>This evening of our life, love,</l>
					<l>⁠Shall go and come no more.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>When we have passed away, love,</l>
					<l>All things will keep their name;</l>
					<l>But yet no life on earth, love,</l>
					<l>⁠With ours will be same.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The daisies will be there, love,</l>
					<l>⁠The stars in heaven will shine:</l>
					<l>I shall not feel thy wish, love,</l>
					<l>⁠Nor thou my hand in thine.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>A better time will come, love.</l>
					<l>⁠And better souls be born:</l>
					<l>I would not be the best, love,</l>
					<l>⁠To leave thee now forlorn.</l>

				<lg>
					<l>"I grant you ample leave</l>
					<l>To use the hoary formula 'I am'</l>
					<l>Naming the emptiness where thought is not;</l>
					<l>But fill the void with definition, 'I'</l>
					<l>Will be no more a datum than the words</l>
					<l>You link false inference with, the 'Since' &amp; 'so'</l>
					<l>That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl.</l>
					<l>Resolve your 'Ego', it is all one web</l>
					<l>With vibrant ether clotted into worlds:</l>
					<l>Your subject, self, or self-assertive 'I'</l>
					<l>Turns nought but object, melts to molecules,</l>
					<l>Is stripped from naked Being with the rest</l>
					<l>Of those rag-garments named the Universe.</l>
					<l>Or if, in strife to keep your 'Ego' strong</l>
					<l>You make it weaver of the etherial light,</l>
					<l>Space, motion, solids &amp; the dream of Time--</l>
					<l>Why, still 'tis Being looking from the dark,</l>
					<l>The core, the centre of your consciousness,</l>
					<l>That notes your bubble-world: sense, pleasure, pain,</l>
					<l>What are they but a shifting otherness,</l>
					<l>Phantasmal flux of moments?--"</l>

				<teiSubTitle>Mid My Gold-Brown Curls</teiSubTitle>
				<lg>
					<l>'Mid my gold-brown curls</l>
					<l>There twined a silver hair:</l>
					<l>I plucked it idly out</l>
					<l>And scarcely knew 'twas there.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Coiled in my velvet sleeve it lay</l>
					<l>And like a serpent hissed:</l>
					<l>"Me thou canst pluck &amp; fling away,</l>
					<l>One hair is lightly missed;</l>
					<l>But how on that near day</l>
					<l>When all the wintry army muster in array?"</l>
				</lg>

			<div type="content">
				<teiSubTitle>Agatha</teiSubTitle>
				<lg>
					<l>COME with me to the mountain, not where rocks</l>
					<l>Soar harsh above the troops of hurrying pines,</l>
					<l>But where the earth spreads soft and rounded breasts</l>
					<l>To feed her children; where the generous hills</l>
					<l>Lift a green isle betwixt the sky and plain</l>
					<l>To keep some Old World things aloof from change.</l>
					<l>Here too 't is hill and hollow: new-born streams.</l>
					<l>With sweet enforcement, joyously compelled</l>
					<l>Like laughing children, hurry down the steeps,</l>
					<l>And make a dimpled chase athwart the stones;</l>
					<l>Pine woods are black upon the heights, the slopes</l>
					<l>Are green with pasture, and the bearded corn</l>
					<l>Fringes the blue above the sudden ridge:</l>
					<l>A little world whose round horizon cuts</l>
					<l>This isle of hills with heaven for a sea,</l>
					<l>Save in clear moments when southwestward gleams</l>
					<l>France by the Rhine, melting anon to haze.</l>
					<l>The monks of old chose here their still retreat, .</l>
					<l>And called it by the Blessed Virgin's name,</l>
					<l>Sancta Maria, which the peasant's tongue,</l>
					<l>Speaking from out the parent's heart that turns</l>
					<l>All loved things into little things, has made</l>
					<l>Sanct Märgen—Holy little Mary, dear</l>
					<l>As all the sweet home things she smiles upon,</l>
					<l>The children and the cows, the apple-trees,</l>
					<l>The cart, the plough, all named with that caress</l>
					<l>Which feigns them little, easy to be held,</l>
					<l>Familiar to the eyes and hand and heart.</l>
					<l>What though a Queen? She puts her crown away</l>
					<l>And with her little Boy wears common clothes,</l>
					<l>Caring for common wants, remembering</l>
					<l>That day when good Saint Joseph left his work</l>
					<l>To marry her with humble trust sublime.</l>
					<l>The monks are gone, their shadows fall no more</l>
					<l>Tall-frocked and cowled athwart the evening fields</l>
					<l>At milking-time; their silent corridors</l>
					<l>Are turned to homes of bare-armed, aproned men,</l>
					<l>Who toil for wife and. children. But the bells,</l>
					<l>Pealing on high from two quaint convent towers,</l>
					<l>Still ring the Catholic signals, summoning</l>
					<l>To grave remembrance of the larger life</l>
					<l>That bears our own, like perishable fruit</l>
					<l>Upon its heaven-wide branches. At their sound</l>
					<l>The shepherd boy far off upon the hill,</l>
					<l>The workers with the saw and at the forge,</l>
					<l>The triple generation round the hearth—</l>
					<l>Grandames and mothers and the flute-voiced girls —</l>
					<l>Fall on their knees and send forth prayerful cries</l>
					<l>To the kind Mother with the little Boy,</l>
					<l>Who pleads for helpless men against the storm,</l>
					<l>Lightning and plagues and all terrific shapes</l>
					<l>Of power supreme.</l>
					<l>Within the prettiest hollow of these hills.</l>
					<l>Just as you enter it, upon the slope</l>
					<l>Stands a low cottage neighbored cheerily</l>
					<l>By running water, which, at farthest end</l>
					<l>Of the same hollow, turns a heavy mill,</l>
					<l>And feeds the pasture for the miller's cows,</l>
					<l>Blanchi and Nägeli, Veilchen and the rest,</l>
					<l>Matrons with faces as Griselda mild,</l>
					<l>Coming at call. And on the farthest height</l>
					<l>A little tower looks out above the pines</l>
					<l>Where mounting you will find a sanctuary</l>
					<l>Open and still; without, the silent crowd</l>
					<l>Of heaven-planted, incense-mingling flowers;</l>
					<l>Within, the altar where the Mother sits</l>
					<l>'Mid votive tablets hung from far-off years</l>
					<l>By peasants succored in the peril of fire,</l>
					<l>Fever, or flood, who thought that Mary's love,</l>
					<l>Willing but not omnipotent, had stood</l>
					<l>Between their lives and that dread power which slew</l>
					<l>Their neighbor at their side. The chapel bell</l>
					<l>Will melt to gentlest music ere it reach</l>
					<l>That cottage on the slope, whose garden gate</l>
					<l>Has caught the rose-tree boughs and stands ajar;</l>
					<l>So does the door, to let the sunbeams in;</l>
					<l>For in the slanting sunbeams angels come</l>
					<l>And visit Agatha who dwells within —</l>
					<l>Old Agatha, whose cousins Kate and Nell</l>
					<l>Are housed by her in Love and Duty's name,</l>
					<l>They being feeble, with small withered wits,</l>
					<l>And she believing that the higher gift</l>
					<l>Was given to be shared. So Agatha</l>
					<l>Shares her one room, all neat on afternoons,</l>
					<l>As if some memory were sacred there</l>
					<l>And everything within the four low walls</l>
					<l>An honored relic.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠One long summer's day</l>
					<l>An angel entered at the rose-hung gate,</l>
					<l>With skirts pale blue, a brow to quench the pearl,</l>
					<l>Hair soft and blonde as infants', plenteous</l>
					<l>As hers who made the wavy lengths once speak</l>
					<l>The grateful worship of a rescued soul.</l>
					<l>The angel paused before the open door</l>
					<l>To give good day. "Come in," said Agatha.</l>
					<l>I followed close, and watched and listened there.</l>
					<l>The angel was a lady, noble, young,</l>
					<l>Taught in all seemliness that fits a court,</l>
					<l>All lore that shapes the mind to delicate use,</l>
					<l>Yet quiet, lowly, as a meek white dove</l>
					<l>That with its presence teaches gentleness.</l>
					<l>Men called her Countess Linda; little girls</l>
					<l>In Freiburg town, orphans whom she caressed,</l>
					<l>Said Mamma Linda: yet her years were few,</l>
					<l>Her outward beauties all in budding time,</l>
					<l>Her virtues the aroma of the plant</l>
					<l>That dwells in all its being, root, stem, leaf,</l>
					<l>And waits not ripeness.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠"Sit," said Agatha.</l>
					<l>Her cousins were at work in neighboring homes</l>
					<l>But yet she was not lonely; all things round</l>
					<l>Seemed filled with noiseless yet responsive life,</l>
					<l>As of a child at breast that gently clings:</l>
					<l>Not sunlight only or the breathing flowers</l>
					<l>Or the swift shadows of the birds and bees,</l>
					<l>But all the household goods, which, polished fair</l>
					<l>By hands that cherished them for service done,</l>
					<l>Shone as with glad content. The wooden beams</l>
					<l>Dark and yet friendly, easy to be reached.</l>
					<l>Bore three white crosses for a speaking sign;</l>
					<l>The walls had little pictures hung a-row,</l>
					<l>Telling the stories of Saint Ursula,</l>
					<l>And Saint Elizabeth, the lowly queen;</l>
					<l>And on the bench that served for table too,</l>
					<l>Skirting the wall to save the narrow space,</l>
					<l>There lay the Catholic books, inherited</l>
					<l>From those old times when printing still was young</l>
					<l>With stout-limbed promise, like a sturdy boy.</l>
					<l>And in the farthest corner stood the bed</l>
					<l>Where o'er the pillow hung two pictures wreathed</l>
					<l>With fresh-plucked ivy: one the Virgin's death,</l>
					<l>And one her flowering tomb, while high above</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The poems of George Eliot 1884 plate facing p311.png</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>'Fair Countess Linda sat upon the bench,</l>
					<l>Close fronting the old knitter."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>She smiling bends and lets her girdle down</l>
					<l>For ladder to the soul that cannot trust</l>
					<l>In life which outlasts burial. Agatha</l>
					<l>Sat at her knitting, aged, upright, slim.</l>
					<l>And spoke her welcome with mild dignity.</l>
					<l>She kept the company of kings and queens</l>
					<l>And mitred saints who sat below the feet</l>
					<l>Of Francis with the ragged frock and wounds;</l>
					<l>And Rank for her meant Duty, various,</l>
					<l>Yet equal in its worth, done worthily.</l>
					<l>Command was service; humblest service done</l>
					<l>By willing and discerning souls was glory.</l>
					<l>Fair Countess Linda sat upon the bench,</l>
					<l>Close fronting the old knitter, and they talked</l>
					<l>With sweet antiphony of young and old.</l>

					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>You like our valley, lady? I am glad</l>
					<l>You thought it well to come again. But rest —</l>
					<l>The walk is long from Master Michael's inn.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yes, but no walk is prettier.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠It is true:</l>
					<l>There lacks no blessing here, the waters all</l>
					<l>Have virtues like the garments of the Lord,</l>
					<l>And heal much sickness; then, the crops and cows</l>
					<l>Flourish past speaking, and the garden flowers,</l>
					<l>Pink, blue, and purple, 't is a joy to see</l>
					<l>How they yield honey for the singing bees.</l>
					<l>I would the whole world were as good a home.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And you are well off, Agatha?—your friends</l>
					<l>Left you a certain bread: is it not so?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Not so at all, dear lady. I had naught,</l>
					<l>Was a poor orphan; but I came to tend</l>
					<l>Here in this house, an old afflicted pair,</l>
					<l>Who wore out slowly; and the last who died,</l>
					<l>Full thirty years ago, left me this roof</l>
					<l>And all the household stuff. It was great wealth,</l>
					<l>And so I had a home for Kate and Nell.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>But how, then, have you earned your daily bread</l>
					<l>These thirty years?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Oh, that is easy earning.</l>
					<l>We help the neighbors, and our bit and sup</l>
					<l>Is never failing: they have work for us</l>
					<l>In house and field, all sorts of odds and ends,</l>
					<l>Patching and mending, turning o'er the hay,</l>
					<l>Holding sick children—there is always work;</l>
					<l>And they are very good—the neighbors are:</l>
					<l>Weigh not our bits of work with weight and scale,</l>
					<l>But glad themselves with giving us good shares</l>
					<l>Of meat and drink; and in the big farmhouse</l>
					<l>When cloth comes home from weaving, the good wife</l>
					<l>Cuts me a piece—this very gown—and says:</l>
					<l>"Here, Agatha, you old maid, you have time</l>
					<l>To pray for Hans who is gone soldiering:</l>
					<l>The saints might help him, and they have much to do,</l>
					<l>'T were well they were besought to think of him."</l>
					<l>She spoke half jesting, but I pray, I pray</l>
					<l>For poor young Hans. I take it much to heart</l>
					<l>That other people are worse off than I—</l>
					<l>I ease my soul with praying for them all.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>That is your way of singing, Agatha;</l>
					<l>Just as the nightingales pour forth sad songs,</l>
					<l>And when they reach men's ears they make men's hearts</l>
					<l>Feel the more kindly.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠Nay, I cannot sing:</l>
					<l>My voice is hoarse, and oft I think my prayers</l>
					<l>Are foolish, feeble things; for Christ is good</l>
					<l>Whether I pray or not—the Virgin's heart</l>
					<l>Is kinder far than mine; and then I stop</l>
					<l>And feel I can do naught toward helping men,</l>
					<l>Till out it comes, like tears that will not hold,</l>
					<l>And I must pray again for all the world.</l>
					<l>'T is good to me—I mean the neighbors are:</l>
					<l>To Kate and Nell too. I have money saved</l>
					<l>To go on pilgrimage the second time.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And do you mean to go on pilgrimage</l>
					<l>With all your years to carry, Agatha?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The years are light, dear lady: 't is my sins</l>
					<l>Are heavier than I would. And I shall go</l>
					<l>All the way to Einsiedeln with that load:</l>
					<l>I need to work it off.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>What sort of sins,</l>
					<l>Dear Agatha? I think they must be small.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Nay, but they may be greater than I know;</l>
					<l>'T is but dim light I see by. So I try</l>
					<l>All ways I know of to be cleansed and pure.</l>
					<l>I would not sink where evil spirits are.</l>
					<l>There's perfect goodness somewhere: so I strive.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>You were the better for that pilgrimage</l>
					<l>You made before? The shrine is beautiful;</l>
					<l>And then you saw fresh country all the way.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yes, that is true. And ever since that time</l>
					<l>The world seems greater, and the Holy Church</l>
					<l>More wonderful. The blessed pictures all,</l>
					<l>The heavenly images with books and wings,</l>
					<l>Are company to me through the day and night.</l>
					<l>The time! the time! It never seemed far back,</l>
					<l>Only to father's father and his kin</l>
					<l>That lived before him. But the time stretched out</l>
					<l>After that pilgrimage: I seemed to see</l>
					<l>Far back, and yet I knew time lay behind,</l>
					<l>As there are countries lying still behind</l>
					<l>The highest mountains, there in Switzerland.</l>
					<l>Oh, it is great to go on pilgrimage!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Perhaps some neighbors will be pilgrims too,</l>
					<l>And you can start together in a band.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Not from these hills: people are busy here.</l>
					<l>The beasts want tendance. One who is not missed</l>
					<l>Can go and pray for others who must work.</l>
					<l>I owe it to all neighbors, young and old;</l>
					<l>For they are good past thinking—lads and girls</l>
					<l>Given to mischief, merry naughtiness,</l>
					<l>Quiet it, as the hedgehogs smooth their spines,</l>
					<l>For fear of hurting poor old Agatha.</l>
					<l>'T is pretty: why, the cherubs in the sky</l>
					<l>Look young and merry, and the angels play</l>
					<l>On citherns, lutes, and all sweet instruments.</l>
					<l>I would have young things merry. See the Lord!</l>
					<l>A little baby playing with the birds;</l>
					<l>And how the Blessed Mother smiles at him.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>I think you are too happy, Agatha,</l>
					<l>To care for heaven. Earth contents you well.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Nay, nay, I shall be called, and I shall go</l>
					<l>Right willingly. I shall get helpless, blind,</l>
					<l>Be like an old stalk to be plucked away:</l>
					<l>The garden must be cleared for young spring plants.</l>
					<l>'T is home beyond the grave, the most are there,</l>
					<l>All those we pray to, all the Church's lights—</l>
					<l>And poor old souls are welcome in their rags:</l>
					<l>One sees it by the pictures. Good Saint Ann,</l>
					<l>The Virgin's mother, she is very old.</l>
					<l>And had her troubles with her husband too.</l>
					<l>Poor Kate and Nell are younger far than I,</l>
					<l>But they will have this roof to cover them.</l>
					<l>I shall go willingly; and willingness</l>
					<l>Makes the yoke easy and the burden light.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>When you go southward in your pilgrimage,</l>
					<l>Come to see me in Freiburg, Agatha.</l>
					<l>Where you have friends you should not go to inns.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yes, I will gladly come to see you, lady,</l>
					<l>And you will give me sweet hay for a bed.</l>
					<l>And in the morning I shall wake betimes</l>
					<l>And start when all the birds begin to sing.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>You wear your smart clothes on the pilgrimage,</l>
					<l>Such pretty clothes as all the women here</l>
					<l>Keep by them for their best: a velvet cap</l>
					<l>And collar golden-broidered? They look well</l>
					<l>On old and young alike.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Agatha</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠Nay, I have none—</l>
					<l>Never had better clothes than these you see.</l>
					<l>Good clothes are pretty, but one sees them best</l>
					<l>When others wear them, and I somehow thought</l>
					<l>'T was not worth while. I had so many things</l>
					<l>More than some neighbors, I was partly shy</l>
					<l>Of wearing better clothes than they, and now</l>
					<l>I am so old and custom is so strong</l>
					<l>'T would hurt me sore to put on finery.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>
						<speaker>Countess Linda</speaker>
					</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Your gray hair is a crown, dear Agatha.</l>
					<l>Shake hands; good-by. The sun is going down,</l>
					<l>And I must see the glory from the hill.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠I stayed among those hills; and oft heard more</l>
					<l>Of Agatha. I liked to hear her name,</l>
					<l>As that of one half grandame and half saint,</l>
					<l>Uttered with reverent playfulness. The lads</l>
					<l>And younger men all called her mother, aunt,</l>
					<l>Or granny, with their pet diminutives,</l>
					<l>And bade their lasses and their brides behave</l>
					<l>Right well to one who surely made a link</l>
					<l>'Twixt faulty folk and God by loving both:</l>
					<l>Not one but counted service done by her,</l>
					<l>Asking no pay save just her daily bread.</l>
					<l>At feasts and weddings, when they passed in groups</l>
					<l>Along the vale, and the good country wine,</l>
					<l>Being vocal in them, made them quire along</l>
					<l>In quaintly mingled mirth and piety,</l>
					<l>They fain must jest and play some friendly trick</l>
					<l>On three old maids; but when the moment came</l>
					<l>Always they bated breath and made their sport</l>
					<l>Gentle as feather-stroke, that Agatha</l>
					<l>Might like the waking for the love it showed.</l>
					<l>Their song made happy music 'mid the hills,</l>
					<l>For nature tuned their race to harmony,</l>
					<l>And poet Hans, the tailor, wrote them songs</l>
					<l>That grew from out their life, as crocuses</l>
					<l>From out the meadow's moistness. 'T was his song</l>
					<l>They oft sang, wending homeward from a feast—</l>
					<l>The song I give you. It brings in, you see.</l>
					<l>Their gentle jesting with the three old maids.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Midnight by the chapel bell!</l>
					<l>Homeward, homeward all, farewell!</l>
					<l>I with you, and you with me,</l>
					<l>Miles are short with company.</l>
					<l>⁠Heart of Mary, bless the way,</l>
					<l>⁠Keep us all by night and day!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Moon and stars at feast with night</l>
					<l>Now have drunk their fill of light.</l>
					<l>Home they hurry, making time</l>
					<l>Trot apace, like merry rhyme.</l>
					<l>⁠Heart of Mary, mystic rose,</l>
					<l>⁠Send us all a sweet repose!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Swiftly through the wood down hill,</l>
					<l>Run till you can hear the mill</l>
					<l>Toni's ghost is wandering now,</l>
					<l>Shaped just like a snow-white cow.</l>
					<l>⁠Heart of Mary, morning star,</l>
					<l>⁠Ward off danger, near or far!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Toni's wagon with its load</l>
					<l>Fell and crushed him in the road</l>
					<l>'Twixt these pine-trees. Never fear!</l>
					<l>Give a neighbor's ghost good cheer.</l>
					<l>⁠Holy Babe, our God and Brother,</l>
					<l>⁠Bind us fast to one another!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Hark! the mill is at its work,</l>
					<l>Now we pass beyond the murk</l>
					<l>To the hollow, where the moon</l>
					<l>Makes her silvery afternoon.</l>
					<l>⁠Good Saint Joseph, faithful spouse.</l>
					<l>⁠Help us all to keep our vows!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Here the three old maidens dwell,</l>
					<l>Agatha and Kate and Nell;</l>
					<l>See, the moon shines on the thatch.</l>
					<l>We will go and shake the latch.</l>
					<l>⁠Heart of Mary, cup of joy,</l>
					<l>⁠Give us mirth without alloy!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Hush, 't is here, no noise, sing low,</l>
					<l>Rap with gentle knuckles—so!</l>
					<l>Like the little tapping birds,</l>
					<l>On the door; then sing good words.</l>
					<l>⁠Meek Saint Anna, old and fair,</l>
					<l>⁠Hallow all the snow-white hair!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Little maidens old, sweet dreams!</l>
					<l>Sleep one sleep till morning beams.</l>
					<l>Mothers ye, who help us all,</l>
					<l>Quick at hand, if ill befall.</l>
					<l>⁠Holy Gabriel, lily-laden,</l>
					<l>⁠Bless the aged mother-maiden!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Forward, mount the broad hillside</l>
					<l>Swift as soldiers when they ride.</l>
					<l>See the two towers how they peep,</l>
					<l>Round-capped giants, o'er the steep.</l>
					<l>⁠Heart of Mary, by thy sorrow,</l>
					<l>⁠Keep us upright through the morrow!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Now they rise quite suddenly</l>
					<l>Like a man from bended knee,</l>
					<l>Now Saint Märgen is in sight.</l>

				<teiSubTitle>A Minor Prophet</teiSubTitle>
				<lg>
					<l>IHAVE a friend, a vegetarian seer,</l>
					<l>By name Elias Baptist Butterworth,</l>
					<l>A harmless, bland, disinterested man,</l>
					<l>Whose ancestors in Cromwell's day believed</l>
					<l>The Second Advent certain in five years,</l>
					<l>But when King Charles the Second came instead,</l>
					<l>Revised their date and sought another world:</l>
					<l>I mean—not heaven but—America.</l>
					<l>A fervid stock, whose generous hope embraced</l>
					<l>The fortunes of mankind, not stopping short</l>
					<l>At rise of leather, or the fall of gold,</l>
					<l>Nor listening to the voices of the time</l>
					<l>As housewives listen to a cackling hen,</l>
					<l>With wonder whether she has laid her egg</l>
					<l>On their own nest-egg. Still they did insist</l>
					<l>Somewhat too wearisomely on the joys</l>
					<l>Of their Millennium, when coats and hats</l>
					<l>Would all be of one pattern, books and songs</l>
					<l>All fit for Sundays, and the casual talk</l>
					<l>As good as sermons preached extempore.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And in Elias the ancestral zeal</l>
					<l>Breathes strong as ever, only modified</l>
					<l>By Transatlantic air and modern thought.</l>
					<l>You could not pass him in the street and fail</l>
					<l>To note his shoulders' long declivity.</l>
					<l>Beard to the waist, swan-neck, and large pale eyes;</l>
					<l>Or, when he lifts his hat, to mark his hair</l>
					<l>Brushed back to show his great capacity—</l>
					<l>A full grain's length at the angle of the brow</l>
					<l>Proving him witty, while the shallower men</l>
					<l>Only seem witty in their repartees.</l>
					<l>Not that he 's vain, but that his doctrine needs</l>
					<l>The testimony of his frontal lobe.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>On all points he adopts the latest views;</l>
					<l>Takes for the key of universal Mind</l>
					<l>The "levitation" of stout gentlemen;</l>
					<l>Believes the Rappings are not spirits' work,</l>
					<l>But the Thought-atmosphere's, a stream of brains</l>
					<l>In correlated force of raps, as proved</l>
					<l>By motion, heat, and science generally;</l>
					<l>The spectrum, for example, which has shown</l>
					<l>The selfsame metals in the sun as here;</l>
					<l>So the Thought-atmosphere is everywhere:</l>
					<l>High truths that glimmered under other names</l>
					<l>To ancient sages, whence good scholarship</l>
					<l>Applied to Eleusinian mysteries—</l>
					<l>The Vedas—Tripitaka—Vendidad—</l>
					<l>Might furnish weaker proof for weaker minds</l>
					<l>That Thought was rapping in the hoary past,</l>
					<l>And might have edified the Greeks by raps</l>
					<l>At the greater Dionysia, if their ears</l>
					<l>Had not been filled with Sophoclean verse.</l>
					<l>And when all Earth is vegetarian—</l>
					<l>When, lacking butchers, quadrupeds die out,</l>
					<l>And less Thought-atmosphere is reabsorbed</l>
					<l>By nerves of insects parasitical,</l>
					<l>Those higher truths, seized now by higher minds</l>
					<l>But not expressed (the insects hindering),</l>
					<l>Will either flash out into eloquence.</l>
					<l>Or better still, be comprehensible</l>
					<l>By rappings simply, without need of roots.</l>
					<l>'T is on this theme—the vegetarian world—</l>
					<l>That good Elias willingly expands:</l>
					<l>He loves to tell in mildly nasal tones</l>
					<l>And vowels stretched to suit the widest views,</l>
					<l>The future fortunes of our infant Earth—</l>
					<l>When it will be too full of human kind</l>
					<l>To have the room for wilder animals.</l>
					<l>Saith he, Sahara will be populous</l>
					<l>With families of gentlemen retired</l>
					<l>From commerce in more Central Africa,</l>
					<l>Who order coolness as we order coal.</l>
					<l>And have a lobe anterior strong enough</l>
					<l>To think away the sand-storms. Science thus</l>
					<l>Will leave no spot on this terraqueous globe</l>
					<l>Unfit to be inhabited by man.</l>
					<l>The chief of animals: all meaner brutes</l>
					<l>Will have been smoked and elbowed out of life.</l>
					<l>No lions then shall lap Caffrarian pools,</l>
					<l>Or shake the Atlas with their midnight roar:</l>
					<l>Even the slow, slime-loving crocodile,</l>
					<l>The last of animals to take a hint,</l>
					<l>Will then retire forever from a scene</l>
					<l>Where public feeling strongly sets against him.</l>
					<l>Fishes may lead carnivorous lives obscure,</l>
					<l>But must not dream of culinary rank</l>
					<l>Or being dished in good society.</l>
					<l>Imagination in that distant age,</l>
					<l>Aiming at fiction called historical,</l>
					<l>Will vainly try to reconstruct the times</l>
					<l>When it was men's preposterous delight</l>
					<l>To sit astride live horses, which consumed</l>
					<l>Materials for incalculable cakes;</l>
					<l>When there were milkmaids who drew milk from cows</l>
					<l>With udders kept abnormal for that end</l>
					<l>Since the rude mythopœic period</l>
					<l>Of Aryan dairymen, who did not blush</l>
					<l>To call their milkmaid and their daughter one—</l>
					<l>Helplessly gazing at the Milky Way,</l>
					<l>Nor dreaming of the astral cocoa-nuts</l>
					<l>Quite at the service of posterity.</l>
					<l>'T is to be feared, though, that the duller boys,</l>
					<l>Much given to anachronisms and nuts</l>
					<l>(Elias has confessed boys will be boys),</l>
					<l>May write a jockey for a centaur, think</l>
					<l>Europa's suitor was an Irish bull,</l>
					<l>Æsop a journalist who wrote up Fox,</l>
					<l>And Bruin a chief swindler upon 'Change.</l>
					<l>Boys will be boys, but dogs will all be moral,</l>
					<l>With longer alimentary canals</l>
					<l>Suited to diet vegetarian.</l>
					<l>The uglier breeds will fade from memory,</l>
					<l>Or, being palæontological,</l>
					<l>Live but as portraits in large learned books,</l>
					<l>Distasteful to the feelings of an age</l>
					<l>Nourished on purest beauty. Earth will hold</l>
					<l>No stupid brutes, no cheerful queernesses,</l>
					<l>No naïve cunning, grave absurdity.</l>
					<l>Wart-pigs with tender and parental grunts,</l>
					<l>Wombats much flattened as to their contour,</l>
					<l>Perhaps from too much crushing in the ark,</l>
					<l>But taking meekly that fatality;</l>
					<l>The serious cranes, unstung by ridicule;</l>
					<l>Long-headed, short-legged, solemn-looking curs,</l>
					<l>(Wise, silent critics of a flippant age);</l>
					<l>The silly straddling foals, the weak-brained geese</l>
					<l>Hissing fallaciously at sound of wheels—</l>
					<l>All these rude products will have disappeared</l>
					<l>Along with every faulty human type.</l>
					<l>By dint of diet vegetarian</l>
					<l>All will be harmony of hue and line,</l>
					<l>Bodies and minds all perfect, limbs well-turned,</l>
					<l>And talk quite free from aught erroneous.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus far Elias in his seer's mantle:</l>
					<l>But at this climax in his prophecy</l>
					<l>My sinking spirits, fearing to be swamped,</l>
					<l>Urge me to speak. "High prospects these, my friend,</l>
					<l>Setting the weak carnivorous brain astretch;</l>
					<l>We will resume the thread another day."</l>
					<l>"To-morrow," cries Elias, "at this hour?"</l>
					<l>"No, not to-morrow—I shall have a cold—</l>
					<l>At least I feel some soreness—this endemic—</l>
					<l>Good-by."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠No tears are sadder than the smile</l>
					<l>With which I quit Elias. Bitterly</l>
					<l>I feel that every change upon this earth</l>
					<l>Is bought with sacrifice. My yearnings fail</l>
					<l>To reach that high apocalyptic mount</l>
					<l>Which shows in bird's-eye view a perfect world,</l>
					<l>Or enter warmly into other joys</l>
					<l>Than those of faulty, struggling human kind.</l>
					<l>That strain upon my soul's too feeble wing</l>
					<l>Ends in ignoble floundering: I fall</l>
					<l>Into short-sighted pity for the men</l>
					<l>Who living in those perfect future times</l>
					<l>Will not know half the dear imperfect things</l>
					<l>That move my smiles and tears—will never know</l>
					<l>The fine old incongruities that raise</l>
					<l>My friendly laugh; the innocent conceits</l>
					<l>That like a needless eyeglass or black patch</l>
					<l>Give those who wear them harmless happiness;</l>
					<l>The twists and cracks in our poor earthenware,</l>
					<l>That touch me to more conscious fellowship</l>
					<l>(I am not myself the finest Parian)</l>
					<l>With my coevals. So poor Colin Clout,</l>
					<l>To whom raw onion gives prospective zest,</l>
					<l>Consoling hours of dampest wintry work,</l>
					<l>Could hardly fancy any regal joys</l>
					<l>Quite unimpregnate with the onion's scent:</l>
					<l>Perhaps his highest hopes are not all clear</l>
					<l>Of waftings from that energetic bulb:</l>
					<l>'T is well that onion is not heresy.</l>
					<l>Speaking in parable, I am Colin Clout.</l>
					<l>A clinging flavor penetrates my life —</l>
					<l>My onion is imperfectness: I cleave</l>
					<l>To nature's blunders, evanescent types</l>
					<l>Which sages banish from Utopia.</l>
					<l>"Not worship beauty?" say you. Patience, friend!</l>
					<l>I worship in the temple with the rest;</l>
					<l>But by my hearth I keep a sacred nook</l>
					<l>For gnomes and dwarfs, duck-footed waddling elves</l>
					<l>Who stitched and hammered for the weary man</l>
					<l>In days of old. And in that piety</l>
					<l>I clothe ungainly forms inherited</l>
					<l>From toiling generations, daily bent</l>
					<l>At desk, or plough, or loom, or in the mine,</l>
					<l>In pioneering labors for the world.</l>
					<l>Nay, I am apt when floundering confused</l>
					<l>From too rash flight, to grasp at paradox,</l>
					<l>And pity future men who will not know</l>
					<l>A keen experience with pity blent,</l>
					<l>The pathos exquisite of lovely minds</l>
					<l>Hid in harsh forms—not penetrating them</l>
					<l>Like fire divine within a common bush</l>
					<l>Which glows transfigured by the heavenly guest,</l>
					<l>So that men put their shoes off; but encaged</l>
					<l>Like a sweet child within some thick-walled cell,</l>
					<l>Who leaps and fails to hold the window-bars,</l>
					<l>But having shown a little dimpled hand</l>
					<l>Is visited thenceforth by tender hearts</l>
					<l>Whose eyes keep watch about the prison walls.</l>
					<l>A foolish, nay, a wicked paradox!</l>
					<l>For purest pity is the eye of love</l>
					<l>Melting at sight of sorrow; and to grieve</l>
					<l>Because it sees no sorrow, shows a love</l>
					<l>Warped from its truer nature, turned to love</l>
					<l>Of merest habit, like the miser's greed.</l>
					<l>But I am Colin still: my prejudice</l>
					<l>Is for the flavor of my daily food.</l>
					<l>Not that I doubt the world is growing still</l>
					<l>As once it grew from Chaos and from Night;</l>
					<l>Or have a soul too shrunken for the hope</l>
					<l>Which dawned in human breasts, a double morn,</l>
					<l>With earliest watchings of the rising light</l>
					<l>Chasing the darkness; and through many an age</l>
					<l>Has raised the vision of a future time</l>
					<l>That stands an Angel with a face all mild</l>
					<l>Spearing the demon. I too rest in faith</l>
					<l>That man's perfection is the crowning flower,</l>
					<l>Toward which the urgent sap in life's great tree</l>
					<l>Is pressing—seen in puny blossoms now.</l>
					<l>But in the world's great morrows to expand</l>
					<l>With broadest petal and with deepest glow.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yet, see the patched and plodding citizen</l>
					<l>Waiting upon the pavement with the throng</l>
					<l>While some victorious world-hero makes</l>
					<l>Triumphal entry, and the peal of shouts</l>
					<l>And flash of faces 'neath uplifted hats</l>
					<l>Run like a storm of joy along the streets!</l>
					<l>He says, "God bless him!" almost with a sob,</l>
					<l>As the great hero passes; he is glad</l>
					<l>The world holds mighty men and mighty deeds;</l>
					<l>The music stirs his pulses like strong wine,</l>
					<l>The moving splendor touches him with awe—</l>
					<l>'T is glory shed around the common weal,</l>
					<l>And he will pay his tribute willingly,</l>
					<l>Though with the pennies earned by sordid toil.</l>
					<l>Perhaps the hero's deeds have helped to bring</l>
					<l>A time when every honest citizen</l>
					<l>Shall wear a coat unpatched. And yet he feels</l>
					<l>More easy fellowship with neighbors there</l>
					<l>Who look on too; and he will soon relapse</l>
					<l>From noticing the banners and the steeds</l>
					<l>To think with pleasure there is just one bun</l>
					<l>Left in his pocket, that may serve to tempt</l>
					<l>The wide-eyed lad, whose weight is all too much</l>
					<l>For that young mother's arms: and then he falls</l>
					<l>To dreamy picturing of sunny days</l>
					<l>When he himself was a small big-cheeked lad</l>
					<l>In some far village where no heroes came,</l>
					<l>And stood a listener 'twixt his father's legs</l>
					<l>In the warm firelight, while the old folk talked</l>
					<l>And shook their heads and looked upon the floor;</l>
					<l>And he was puzzled, thinking life was fine—</l>
					<l>The bread and cheese so nice all through the year</l>
					<l>And Christmas sure to come. Oh that good time!</l>
					<l>He, could he choose, would have those days again</l>
					<l>And see the dear old-fashioned things once more.</l>
					<l>But soon the wheels and drums have all passed by</l>
					<l>And tramping feet are heard like sudden rain:</l>
					<l>The quiet startles our good citizen;</l>
					<l>He feels the child upon his arms, and knows</l>
					<l>He is with the people making holiday</l>
					<l>Because of hopes for better days to come.</l>
					<l>But Hope to him was like the brilliant west</l>
					<l>Telling of sunrise in a world unknown,</l>
					<l>And from that dazzling curtain of bright hues</l>
					<l>He turned to the familiar face of fields</l>
					<l>Lying all clear in the calm morning land.</l>
					<l>Maybe 't is wiser not to fix a lens</l>
					<l>Too scrutinizing on the glorious times</l>
					<l>When Barbarossa shall arise and shake</l>
					<l>His mountain, good King Arthur come again,</l>
					<l>And all the heroes of such giant soul</l>
					<l>That, living once to cheer mankind with hope,</l>
					<l>They had to sleep until the time was ripe</l>
					<l>For greater deeds to match their greater thought.</l>
					<l>Yet no! the earth yields nothing more Divine</l>
					<l>Than high prophetic vision—than the Seer</l>
					<l>Who fasting from man's meaner joy beholds</l>
					<l>The paths of beauteous order, and constructs</l>
					<l>A fairer type, to shame our low content.</l>
					<l>But prophecy is like potential sound</l>
					<l>Which turned to music seems a voice sublime</l>
					<l>From out the soul of light; but turns to noise</l>
					<l>In scrannel pipes, and makes all ears averse.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The faith that life on earth is being shaped</l>
					<l>To glorious ends, that order, justice, love,</l>
					<l>Mean man's completeness, mean effect as sure</l>
					<l>As roundness in the dew-drop—that great faith</l>
					<l>Is but the rushing and expanding stream</l>
					<l>Of thought, of feeling, fed by all the past.</l>
					<l>Our finest hope is finest memory,</l>
					<l>As they who love in age think youth is blest</l>
					<l>Because it has a life to fill with love.</l>
					<l>Full souls are double mirrors, making still</l>
					<l>An endless vista of fair things before</l>
					<l>Repeating things behind: so faith is strong</l>
					<l>Only when we are strong, shrinks when we shrink.</l>
					<l>It comes when music stirs us, and the chords</l>
					<l>Moving on some grand climax shake our souls</l>
					<l>With influx new that makes new energies.</l>
					<l>It comes in swellings of the heart and tears</l>
					<l>That rise at noble and at gentle deeds—</l>
					<l>At labors of the master-artist's hand</l>
					<l>Which, trembling, touches to a finer end,</l>
					<l>Trembling before an image seen within.</l>
					<l>It comes in moments of heroic love,</l>
					<l>Unjealous joy in joy not made for us—</l>
					<l>In conscious triumph of the good within</l>
					<l>Making us worship goodness that rebukes.</l>
					<l>Even our failures are a prophecy,</l>
					<l>Even our yearnings and our bitter tears</l>
					<l>After that fair and true we cannot grasp;</l>
					<l>As patriots who seem to die in vain</l>
					<l>Make liberty more sacred by their pangs.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Presentiment of better things on earth</l>
					<l>Sweeps in with every force that stirs our souls</l>
					<l>To admiration, self-renouncing love,</l>
					<l>Or thoughts, like light, that bind the world in one,—</l>
					<l>Sweeps like the sense of vastness, when at night</l>
					<l>We hear the roll and dash of waves that break</l>
					<l>Nearer and nearer with the rushing tide,</l>
					<l>Which rises to the level of the cliff</l>
					<l>Because the wide Atlantic rolls behind,</l>
					<l>Throbbing respondent to the far-off orbs.</l>

					<l>Not discerns the thing it sees, </l>

				<teiSubTitle>How Lisa Love the King</teiSubTitle>
				<lg>
					<l>Six hundred years ago, in Dante's time,</l>
					<l>Before his cheek was furrowed by deep rhyme;</l>
					<l>When Europe, fed afresh from Eastern story,</l>
					<l>Was like a garden tangled with the glory</l>
					<l>Of flowers hand-planted and of flowers air-sown,</l>
					<l>Climbing and trailing, budding and full-blown,</l>
					<l>Where purple bells are tossed amid pink stars,</l>
					<l>And springing blades, green troops in innocent wars,</l>
					<l>Crowd every shady spot of teeming earth,</l>
					<l>Making invisible motion visible birth,--</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Six hundred years ago, Palermo town</l>
					<l>Kept holiday. A deed of great renown,</l>
					<l>A high revenge, had freed it from the yoke</l>
					<l>Of hated Frenchmen; and from Calpe's rock</l>
					<l>To where the Bosporus caught the earlier sun,</l>
					<l>'Twas told that Pedro, King of Aragon,</l>
					<l>Was welcomed master of all Sicily,--</l>
					<l>A royal knight, supreme as kings should be</l>
					<l>In strength and gentleness that make high chivalry.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Spain was the favorite home of knightly grace,</l>
					<l>Where generous men rode steeds of generous race;</l>
					<l>Both Spanish, yet half Arab; both inspired</l>
					<l>By mutual spirit, that each motion fired</l>
					<l>With beauteous response, like minstrelsy</l>
					<l>Afresh fulfilling fresh expectancy.</l>
					<l>So, when Palermo made high festival,</l>
					<l>The joy of matrons and of maidens all</l>
					<l>Was the mock terror of the tournament,</l>
					<l>Where safety, with the glimpse of danger blent,</l>
					<l>Took exaltation as from epic song,</l>
					<l>Which greatly tells the pains that to great life belong.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And in all eyes King Pedro was the king</l>
					<l>Of cavaliers; as in a full-gemmed ring</l>
					<l>The largest ruby, or as that bright star</l>
					<l>Whose shining shows us where the Hyads are.</l>
					<l>His the best genet, and he sat it best;</l>
					<l>His weapon, whether tilting or in rest,</l>
					<l>Was worthiest watching; and his face, once seen,</l>
					<l>Gave to the promise of his royal mien</l>
					<l>Such rich fulfilment as the opened eyes</l>
					<l>Of a loved sleeper, or the long-watched rise</l>
					<l>Of vernal day, whose joy o'er stream and meadow flies.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>But of the maiden forms that thick enwreathed</l>
					<l>The broad piazza, and sweet witchery breathed,</l>
					<l>With innocent faces budding all arow,</l>
					<l>From balconies and windows high and low,</l>
					<l>Who was it felt the deep mysterious glow,</l>
					<l>The impregnation with supernal fire</l>
					<l>Of young ideal love, transformed desire,</l>
					<l>Whose passion is but worship of that Best</l>
					<l>Taught by the many-mingled creed of each young breast?</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>'Twas gentle Lisa, of no noble line,</l>
					<l>Child of Bernardo, a rich Florentine,</l>
					<l>Who from his merchant-city hither came</l>
					<l>To trade in drugs; yet kept an honest fame,</l>
					<l>And had the virtue not to try and sell</l>
					<l>Drugs that had none. He loved his riches well,</l>
					<l>But loved them chiefly for his Lisa's sake,</l>
					<l>Whom with a father's care he sought to make</l>
					<l>The bride of some true honorable man,--</l>
					<l>Of Perdicone (so the rumor ran),</l>
					<l>Whose birth was higher than his fortunes were,</l>
					<l>For still your trader likes a mixture fair</l>
					<l>Of blood that hurries to some higher strain</l>
					<l>Than reckoning money's loss and money's gain.</l>
					<l>And of such mixture good may surely come:</l>
					<l>Lord's scions so may learn to cast a sum,</l>
					<l>A trader's grandson bear a well-set head,</l>
					<l>And have less conscious manners, better bred;</l>
					<l>Nor, when he tries to be polite, be rude instead.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>'Twas Perdicone's friends made overtures</l>
					<l>To good Bernardo; so one dame assures</l>
					<l>Her neighbor dame, who notices the youth</l>
					<l>Fixing his eyes on Lisa; and, in truth,</l>
					<l>Eyes that could see her on this summer day</l>
					<l>Might find it hard to turn another way.</l>
					<l>She had a pensive beauty, yet not sad;</l>
					<l>Rather like minor cadences that glad</l>
					<l>The hearts of little birds amid spring boughs:</l>
					<l>And oft the trumpet or the joust would rouse</l>
					<l>Pulses that gave her cheek a finer glow,</l>
					<l>Parting her lips that seemed a mimic bow</l>
					<l>By chiselling Love for play in coral wrought,</l>
					<l>Then quickened by him with the passionate thought,</l>
					<l>The soul that trembled in the lustrous night</l>
					<l>Of slow long eyes. Her body was so slight,</l>
					<l>It seemed she could have floated in the sky,</l>
					<l>And with the angelic choir made symphony;</l>
					<l>But in her cheek's rich tinge, and in the dark</l>
					<l>Of darkest hair and eyes, she bore a mark</l>
					<l>Of kinship to her generous mother-earth,</l>
					<l>The fervid land that gives the plumy palm-trees birth.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>She saw not Perdicone; her young mind</l>
					<l>Dreamed not that any man had ever pined</l>
					<l>For such a little simple maid as she:</l>
					<l>She had but dreamed how heavenly it would be</l>
					<l>To love some hero noble, beauteous, great,</l>
					<l>Who would live stories worthy to narrate,</l>
					<l>Like Roland, or the warriors of Troy,</l>
					<l>The Cid, or Amadis, or that fair boy</l>
					<l>Who conquered every thing beneath the sun,</l>
					<l>And somehow, some time, died at Babylon</l>
					<l>Fighting the Moors. For heroes all were good</l>
					<l>And fair as that archangel who withstood</l>
					<l>The Evil One, the author of all wrong,--</l>
					<l>That Evil One who made the French so strong;</l>
					<l>And now the flower of heroes must he be</l>
					<l>Who drove those tyrants from dear Sicily,</l>
					<l>So that her maids might walk to vespers tranquilly.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Young Lisa saw this hero in the king;</l>
					<l>And as wood-lilies that sweet odors bring</l>
					<l>Might dream the light that opes their modest eyne</l>
					<l>Was lily-odored; and as rites divine,</l>
					<l>Round turf-laid altars, or 'neath roofs of stone,</l>
					<l>Draw sanctity from out the heart alone</l>
					<l>That loves and worships: so the miniature</l>
					<l>Perplexed of her soul's world, all virgin pure,</l>
					<l>Filled with heroic virtues that bright form,</l>
					<l>Raona's royalty, the finished norm</l>
					<l>Of horsemanship, the half of chivalry;</l>
					<l>For how could generous men avengers be,</l>
					<l>Save as God's messengers on coursers fleet?--</l>
					<l>These, scouring earth, made Spain with Syria meet</l>
					<l>In one self-world where the same right had sway,</l>
					<l>And good must grow as grew the blessed day.</l>
					<l>No more: great Love his essence had endued</l>
					<l>With Pedro's form, and, entering, subdued</l>
					<l>The soul of Lisa, fervid and intense,</l>
					<l>Proud in its choice of proud obedience</l>
					<l>To hardship glorified by perfect reverence.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Sweet Lisa homeward carried that dire guest,</l>
					<l>And in her chamber, through the hours of rest,</l>
					<l>The darkness was alight for her with sheen</l>
					<l>Of arms, and plumed helm; and bright between</l>
					<l>Their commoner gloss, like the pure living spring</l>
					<l>'Twixt porphyry lips, or living bird's bright wing</l>
					<l>'Twixt golden wires, the glances of the king</l>
					<l>Flashed on her soul, and waked vibrations there</l>
					<l>Of known delights love-mixed to new and rare:</l>
					<l>The impalpable dream was turned to breathing flesh,</l>
					<l>Chill thought of summer to the warm close mesh</l>
					<l>Of sunbeams held between the citron-leaves,</l>
					<l>Clothing her life of life. Oh! she believes</l>
					<l>That she could be content if he but knew</l>
					<l>(Her poor small self could claim no other due)</l>
					<l>How Lisa's lowly love had highest reach</l>
					<l>Of winged passion, whereto winged speech</l>
					<l>Would be scorched remnants left by mounting flame.</l>
					<l>Though, had she such lame message, were it blame</l>
					<l>To tell what greatness dwelt in her, what rank</l>
					<l>She held in loving? Modest maidens shrank</l>
					<l>From telling love that fed on selfish hope;</l>
					<l>But love, as hopeless as the shattering song,</l>
					<l>Wailed for loved beings who have joined the throng</l>
					<l>Of mighty dead ones. . . . Nay, but she was weak,</l>
					<l>Knew only prayers and ballads, could not speak</l>
					<l>With eloquence, save what dumb creatures have,</l>
					<l>That with small cries and touches small boons crave.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>She watched all day that she might see him pass</l>
					<l>With knights and ladies; but she said, "Alas!</l>
					<l>Though he should see me, it were all as one</l>
					<l>He saw a pigeon sitting on the stone</l>
					<l>Of wall or balcony: some colored spot</l>
					<l>His eye just sees, his mind regardeth not.</l>
					<l>I have no music-touch that could bring nigh</l>
					<l>My love to his soul's hearing. I shall die,</l>
					<l>And he will never know who Lisa was,--</l>
					<l>The trader's child, whose soaring spirit rose</l>
					<l>As hedge-born aloe-flowers that rarest years disclose.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"For were I now a fair deep-breasted queen</l>
					<l>A-horseback, with blonde hair, and tunic green,</l>
					<l>Gold-bordered, like Costanza, I should need</l>
					<l>No change within to make me queenly there:</l>
					<l>For they the royal-hearted women are</l>
					<l>Who nobly love the noblest, yet have grace;</l>
					<l>For needy suffering lives in lowliest place,</l>
					<l>Carrying a choicer sunlight in their smile,</l>
					<l>The heavenliest ray that pitieth the vile.</l>
					<l>My love is such, it cannot choose but soar</l>
					<l>Up to the highest; yet forevermore,</l>
					<l>Though I were happy, throned beside the king,</l>
					<l>I should be tender to each little thing</l>
					<l>With hurt warm breast, that had no speech to tell</l>
					<l>Its inward pang; and I would soothe it well</l>
					<l>With tender touch, and with a low soft moan</l>
					<l>For company: my dumb love-pang is lone,</l>
					<l>Prisoned as topaz-beam within a rough-garbed stone."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>So, inward-wailing, Lisa passed her days.</l>
					<l>Each night the August moon with changing phase</l>
					<l>Looked broader, harder, on her unchanged pain;</l>
					<l>Each noon the heat lay heavier again</l>
					<l>On her despair, until her body frail</l>
					<l>Shrank like the snow that watchers in the vale</l>
					<l>See narrowed on the height each summer morn;</l>
					<l>While her dark glance burnt larger, more forlorn,</l>
					<l>As if the soul within her, all on fire,</l>
					<l>Made of her being one swift funeral-pyre.</l>
					<l>Father and mother saw with sad dismay</l>
					<l>The meaning of their riches melt away;</l>
					<l>For without Lisa what would sequins buy?</l>
					<l>What wish were left if Lisa were to die?</l>
					<l>Through her they cared for summers still to come,</l>
					<l>Else they would be as ghosts without a home</l>
					<l>In any flesh that could feel glad desire.</l>
					<l>They pay the best physicians, never tire</l>
					<l>Of seeking what will soothe her, promising</l>
					<l>That aught she longed for, though it were a thing</l>
					<l>Hard to be come at as the Indian snow,</l>
					<l>Or roses that on Alpine summits blow,</l>
					<l>It should be hers. She answers with low voice,</l>
					<l>She longs for death alone--death is her choice;</l>
					<l>Death is the king who never did think scorn,</l>
					<l>But rescues every meanest soul to sorrow born.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yet one day, as they bent above her bed,</l>
					<l>And watched her in brief sleep, her drooping head</l>
					<l>Turned gently, as the thirsty flowers that feel</l>
					<l>Some moist revival through their petals steal;</l>
					<l>And little flutterings of her lids and lips</l>
					<l>Told of such dreamy joy as sometimes dips</l>
					<l>A skyey shadow in the mind's poor pool.</l>
					<l>She oped her eyes, and turned their dark gems full</l>
					<l>Upon her father, as in utterance dumb</l>
					<l>Of some new prayer that in her sleep had come.</l>
					<l>"What is it, Lisa?"--"Father, I would see</l>
					<l>Minuccio, the great singer; bring him me."</l>
					<l>For always, night and day, her unstilled thought,</l>
					<l>Wandering all o'er its little world, had sought</l>
					<l>How she could reach, by some soft pleading touch,</l>
					<l>King Pedro's soul, that she who loved so much,</l>
					<l>Dying, might have a place within his mind,--</l>
					<l>A little grave which he would sometimes find</l>
					<l>And plant some flower on it,--some thought, some memory kind.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Till in her dream she saw Minuccio</l>
					<l>Touching his viola, and chanting low</l>
					<l>A strain, that, falling on her brokenly,</l>
					<l>Seemed blossoms lightly blown from off a tree;</l>
					<l>Each burthened with a word that was a scent,--</l>
					<l>Raona, Lisa, love, death, tournament;</l>
					<l>Then in her dream she said, "He sings of me,</l>
					<l>Might be my messenger; ah! now I see</l>
					<l>The king is listening"--Then she awoke,</l>
					<l>And, missing her dear dream, that new-born longing spoke.</l>
					<l>She longed for music: that was natural;</l>
					<l>Physicians said it was medicinal;</l>
					<l>The humors might be schooled by true consent</l>
					<l>Of a fine tenor and fine instrument;</l>
					<l>In short, good music, mixed with doctor's stuff,</l>
					<l>Apollo with Asklepios--enough!</l>
					<l>Minuccio, entreated, gladly came.</l>
					<l>(He was a singer of most gentle fame,</l>
					<l>A noble, kindly spirit, not elate</l>
					<l>That he was famous, but that song was great;</l>
					<l>Would sing as finely to this suffering child</l>
					<l>As at the court where princes on him smiled.)</l>
					<l>Gently he entered and sat down by her,</l>
					<l>Asking what sort of strain she would prefer,--</l>
					<l>The voice alone, or voice with viol wed;</l>
					<l>Then, when she chose the last, he preluded</l>
					<l>With magic hand, that summoned from the strings</l>
					<l>Aerial spirits, rare yet palpable wings</l>
					<l>That fanned the pulses of his listener,</l>
					<l>And waked each sleeping sense with blissful stir.</l>
					<l>Her cheek already showed a slow, faint blush;</l>
					<l>But soon the voice, in pure, full, liquid rush,</l>
					<l>Made all the passion, that till now she felt,</l>
					<l>Seem but as cooler waters that in warmer melt.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Finished the song, she prayed to be alone</l>
					<l>With kind Minuccio; for her faith had grown</l>
					<l>To trust him as if missioned like a priest</l>
					<l>With some high grace, that, when his singing ceased,</l>
					<l>Still made him wiser, more magnanimous,</l>
					<l>Than common men who had no genius.</l>
					<l>So, laying her small hand within his palm,</l>
					<l>She told him how that secret, glorious harm</l>
					<l>Of loftiest loving had befallen her;</l>
					<l>That death, her only hope, most bitter were,</l>
					<l>If, when she died, her love must perish too</l>
					<l>As songs unsung, and thoughts unspoken do,</l>
					<l>Which else might live within another breast.</l>
					<l>She said, "Minuccio, the grave were rest,</l>
					<l>If I were sure, that, lying cold and lone,</l>
					<l>My love, my best of life, had safely flown</l>
					<l>And nestled in the bosom of the king.</l>
					<l>See, 'tis a small weak bird, with unfledged wing;</l>
					<l>But you will carry it for me secretly,</l>
					<l>And bear it to the king; then come to me</l>
					<l>And tell me it is safe, and I shall go</l>
					<l>Content, knowing that he I love my love doth know."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Then she wept silently; but each large tear</l>
					<l>Made pleading music to the inward ear</l>
					<l>Of good Minuccio. "Lisa, trust in me,"</l>
					<l>He said, and kissed her fingers loyally:</l>
					<l>"It is sweet law to me to do your will,</l>
					<l>And, ere the sun his round shall thrice fulfil,</l>
					<l>I hope to bring you news of such rare skill</l>
					<l>As amulets have, that aches in trusting bosoms still."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>He needed not to pause and first devise</l>
					<l>How he should tell the king; for in nowise</l>
					<l>Were such love-message worthily bested</l>
					<l>Save in fine verse by music rendered.</l>
					<l>He sought a poet-friend, a Siennese,</l>
					<l>And "Mico, mine," he said, "full oft to please</l>
					<l>Thy whim of sadness I have sung thee strains</l>
					<l>To make thee weep in verse: now pay my pains,</l>
					<l>And write me a canzon divinely sad,</l>
					<l>Sinlessly passionate, and meekly mad</l>
					<l>With young despair, speaking a maiden's heart</l>
					<l>Of fifteen summers, who would fain depart</l>
					<l>From ripening life's new-urgent mystery,--</l>
					<l>Love-choice of one too high her love to be,--</l>
					<l>But cannot yield her breath till she has poured</l>
					<l>Her strength away in this hot-bleeding word,</l>
					<l>Telling the secret of her soul to her soul's lord."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Said Mico, "Nay, that thought is poesy,</l>
					<l>I need but listen as it sings to me.</l>
					<l>Come thou again to-morrow." The third day,</l>
					<l>When linked notes had perfected the lay,</l>
					<l>Minuccio had his summons to the court,</l>
					<l>To make, as he was wont, the moments short</l>
					<l>Of ceremonious dinner to the king.</l>
					<l>This was the time when he had meant to bring</l>
					<l>Melodious message of young Lisa's love;</l>
					<l>He waited till the air had ceased to move</l>
					<l>To ringing silver, till Falernian wine</l>
					<l>Made quickened sense with quietude combine;</l>
					<l>And then with passionate descant made each ear incline.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg></lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Love, thou didst see me, light as morning's breath,</l>
					<l>Roaming a garden in a joyous error,</l>
					<l>Laughing at chases vain, a happy child,</l>
					<l>Till of thy countenance the alluring terror</l>
					<l>In majesty from out the blossoms smiled,</l>
					<l>From out their life seeming a beauteous Death</l>
					<l>O Love, who so didst choose me for thine own</l>
					<l>Taking this little isle to thy great sway,</l>
					<l>See now, it is the honor of thy throne</l>
					<l>That what thou gavest perish not away,</l>
					<l>Nor leave some sweet remembrance to atone</l>
					<l>By life that will be for the brief life gone:</l>
					<l>Hear, ere the shroud o'er these frail limbs be thrown--</l>
					<l>Since every king is vassal unto thee,</l>
					<l>My heart's lord needs must listen loyally--</l>
					<l>O tell him I am waiting for my Death!</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Tell him, for that he hath such royal power</l>
					<l>'Twere hard for him to think how small a thing,</l>
					<l>How slight a sign, would make a wealthy dower</l>
					<l>For one like me, the bride of that pale king</l>
					<l>Whose bed is mine at some swift-nearing hour.</l>
					<l>Go to my lord, and to his memory bring</l>
					<l>That happy birthday of my sorrowing,</l>
					<l>When his large glance made meaner gazers glad,</l>
					<l>Entering the bannered lists: 'twas then I had</l>
					<l>The wound that laid me in the arms of Death.</l>
					<l>Tell him, O Love, I am a lowly maid,</l>
					<l>No more than any little knot of thyme</l>
					<l>That he with careless foot may often tread;</l>
					<l>Yet lowest fragrance oft will mount sublime</l>
					<l>And cleave to things most high and hallowed,</l>
					<l>As doth the fragrance of my life's springtime,</l>
					<l>My lowly love, that, soaring, seeks to climb</l>
					<l>Within his thought, and make a gentle bliss,</l>
					<l>More blissful than if mine, in being his:</l>
					<l>So shall I live in him, and rest in Death.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The strain was new. It seemed a pleading cry,</l>
					<l>And yet a rounded, perfect melody,</l>
					<l>Making grief beauteous as the tear-filled eyes</l>
					<l>Of little child at little miseries.</l>
					<l>Trembling at first, then swelling as it rose,</l>
					<l>Like rising light that broad and broader grows,</l>
					<l>It filled the hall, and so possessed the air,</l>
					<l>That not one living, breathing soul was there,</l>
					<l>Though dullest, slowest, but was quivering</l>
					<l>In Music's grasp, and forced to hear her sing.</l>
					<l>But most such sweet compulsion took the mood</l>
					<l>Of Pedro (tired of doing what he would).</l>
					<l>Whether the words which that strange meaning bore</l>
					<l>Were but the poet's feigning, or aught more,</l>
					<l>Was bounden question, since their aim must be</l>
					<l>At some imagined or true royalty.</l>
					<l>He called Minuccio, and bade him tell</l>
					<l>What poet of the day had writ so well;</l>
					<l>For, though they came behind all former rhymes,</l>
					<l>The verses were not bad for these poor times.</l>
					<l>"Monsignor, they are only three days old,"</l>
					<l>Minuccio said; "but it must not be told</l>
					<l>How this song grew, save to your royal ear."</l>
					<l>Eager, the king withdrew where none was near,</l>
					<l>And gave close audience to Minuccio,</l>
					<l>Who meetly told that love-tale meet to know.</l>
					<l>The king had features pliant to confess</l>
					<l>The presence of a manly tenderness,--</l>
					<l>Son, father, brother, lover, blent in one,</l>
					<l>In fine harmonic exaltation;</l>
					<l>The spirit of religious chivalry.</l>
					<l>He listened, and Minuccio could see</l>
					<l>The tender, generous admiration spread</l>
					<l>O'er all his face, and glorify his head</l>
					<l>With royalty that would have kept its rank,</l>
					<l>Though his brocaded robes to tatters shrank.</l>
					<l>He answered without pause, "So sweet a maid,</l>
					<l>In Nature's own insignia arrayed,</l>
					<l>Though she were come of unmixed trading blood</l>
					<l>That sold and bartered ever since the flood,</l>
					<l>Would have the self-contained and single worth</l>
					<l>Of radiant jewels born in darksome earth.</l>
					<l>Raona were a shame to Sicily,</l>
					<l>Letting such love and tears unhonored be:</l>
					<l>Hasten, Minuccio, tell her that the king</l>
					<l>To-day will surely visit her when vespers ring."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Joyful, Minuccio bore the joyous word,</l>
					<l>And told at full, while none but Lisa heard,</l>
					<l>How each thing had befallen, sang the song,</l>
					<l>And, like a patient nurse who would prolong</l>
					<l>All means of soothing, dwelt upon each tone,</l>
					<l>Each look, with which the mighty Aragon</l>
					<l>Marked the high worth his royal heart assigned</l>
					<l>To that dear place he held in Lisa's mind.</l>
					<l>She listened till the draughts of pure content</l>
					<l>Through all her limbs like some new being went--</l>
					<l>Life, not recovered, but untried before,</l>
					<l>From out the growing world's unmeasured store</l>
					<l>Of fuller, better, more divinely mixed.</l>
					<l>'Twas glad reverse: she had so firmly fixed</l>
					<l>To die, already seemed to fall a veil</l>
					<l>Shrouding the inner glow from light of senses pale.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Her parents, wondering, see her half arise;</l>
					<l>Wondering, rejoicing, see her long dark eyes</l>
					<l>Brimful with clearness, not of 'scaping tears,</l>
					<l>But of some light ethereal that enspheres</l>
					<l>Their orbs with calm, some vision newly learnt</l>
					<l>Where strangest fires erewhile had blindly burnt.</l>
					<l>She asked to have her soft white robe and band</l>
					<l>And coral ornaments; and with her hand</l>
					<l>She gave her long dark locks a backward fall,</l>
					<l>Then looked intently in a mirror small,</l>
					<l>And feared her face might, perhaps, displease the king:</l>
					<l>"In truth," she said, "I am a tiny thing:</l>
					<l>I was too bold to tell what could such visit bring."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Meanwhile the king, revolving in his thought</l>
					<l>That innocent passion, was more deeply wrought</l>
					<l>To chivalrous pity; and at vesper-bell,</l>
					<l>With careless mien which hid his purpose well,</l>
					<l>Went forth on horseback, and, as if by chance</l>
					<l>Passing Bernardo's house, he paused to glance</l>
					<l>At the fine garden of this wealthy man,</l>
					<l>This Tuscan trader turned Palermitan;</l>
					<l>But, presently dismounting, chose to walk</l>
					<l>Amid the trellises, in gracious talk</l>
					<l>With this same trader, deigning even to ask</l>
					<l>If he had yet fulfilled the father's task</l>
					<l>Of marrying that daughter, whose young charms</l>
					<l>Himself, betwixt the passages of arms,</l>
					<l>Noted admiringly. "Monsignor, no,</l>
					<l>She is not married: that were little woe,</l>
					<l>Since she has counted barely fifteen years;</l>
					<l>But all such hopes of late have turned to fears;</l>
					<l>She droops and fades, though, for a space quite brief,--</l>
					<l>Scarce three hours past,--she finds some strange relief."</l>
					<l>The king avised: "'Twere dole to all of us,</l>
					<l>The world should lose a maid so beauteous:</l>
					<l>Let me now see her; since I am her liege lord,</l>
					<l>Her spirits must wage war with death at my strong word."</l>
					<l>In such half-serious playfulness, he wends,</l>
					<l>With Lisa's father and two chosen friends,</l>
					<l>Up to the chamber where she pillowed sits,</l>
					<l>Watching the door that opening admits</l>
					<l>A presence as much better than her dreams,</l>
					<l>As happiness than any longing seems.</l>
					<l>The king advanced, and, with a reverent kiss</l>
					<l>Upon her hand, said, "Lady, what is this?</l>
					<l>You, whose sweet youth should others' solace be,</l>
					<l>Pierce all our hearts, languishing piteously.</l>
					<l>We pray you, for the love of us, be cheered,</l>
					<l>Nor be too reckless of that life, endeared</l>
					<l>To us who know your passing worthiness,</l>
					<l>And count your blooming life as part of our life's bliss."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Those words, that touch upon her hand from him</l>
					<l>Whom her soul worshipped, as far seraphim</l>
					<l>Worship the distant glory, brought some shame</l>
					<l>Quivering upon her cheek, yet thrilled her frame</l>
					<l>With such deep joy she seemed in paradise,</l>
					<l>In wondering gladness, and in dumb surprise,</l>
					<l>That bliss could be so blissful. Then she spoke:</l>
					<l>"Signor, I was too weak to bear the yoke,</l>
					<l>The golden yoke, of thoughts too great for me;</l>
					<l>That was the ground of my infirmity.</l>
					<l>But now I pray your grace to have belief</l>
					<l>That I shall soon be well, nor any more cause grief."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The king alone perceived the covert sense</l>
					<l>Of all her words, which made one evidence,</l>
					<l>With her pure voice and candid loveliness,</l>
					<l>That he had lost much honor, honoring less</l>
					<l>That message of her passionate distress.</l>
					<l>He staid beside her for a little while,</l>
					<l>With gentle looks and speech, until a smile</l>
					<l>As placid as a ray of early morn</l>
					<l>On opening flower-cups o'er her lips was borne</l>
					<l>When he had left her, and the tidings spread</l>
					<l>Through all the town, how he had visited</l>
					<l>The Tuscan trader's daughter, who was sick,</l>
					<l>Men said it was a royal deed, and catholic.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And Lisa? She no longer wished for death;</l>
					<l>But as a poet, who sweet verses saith</l>
					<l>Within his soul, and joys in music there,</l>
					<l>Nor seeks another heaven, nor can bear</l>
					<l>Disturbing pleasures, so was she content,</l>
					<l>Breathing the life of grateful sentiment.</l>
					<l>She thought no maid betrothed could be more blest;</l>
					<l>For treasure must be valued by the test</l>
					<l>Of highest excellence and rarity,</l>
					<l>And her dear joy was best as best could be:</l>
					<l>There seemed no other crown to her delight,</l>
					<l>Now the high loved one saw her love aright.</l>
					<l>Thus her soul thriving on that exquisite mood,</l>
					<l>Spread like the May-time all its beauteous good</l>
					<l>O'er the soft bloom of neck and arms and cheek,</l>
					<l>And strengthened the sweet body, once so weak,</l>
					<l>Until she rose and walked, and, like a bird</l>
					<l>With sweetly rippling throat, she made her spring joys heard.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The king, when he the happy change had seen,</l>
					<l>Trusted the ear of Constance, his fair queen,</l>
					<l>With Lisa's innocent secret, and conferred</l>
					<l>How they should jointly, by their deed and word,</l>
					<l>Honor this maiden's love, which, like the prayer</l>
					<l>Of loyal hermits, never thought to share</l>
					<l>In what it gave. The queen had that chief grace</l>
					<l>Of womanhood, a heart that can embrace</l>
					<l>All goodness in another woman's form;</l>
					<l>And that same day, ere the sun lay too warm</l>
					<l>On southern terraces, a messenger</l>
					<l>Informed Bernardo that the royal pair</l>
					<l>Would straightway visit him, and celebrate</l>
					<l>Their gladness at his daughter's happier state,</l>
					<l>Which they were fain to see. Soon came the king</l>
					<l>On horseback, with his barons, heralding</l>
					<l>The advent of the queen in courtly state;</l>
					<l>And all, descending at the garden gate,</l>
					<l>Streamed with their feathers, velvet, and brocade,</l>
					<l>Through the pleached alleys, till they, pausing, made</l>
					<l>A lake of splendor 'mid the aloes gray;</l>
					<l>When, meekly facing all their proud array,</l>
					<l>The white-robed Lisa with her parents stood,</l>
					<l>As some white dove before the gorgeous brood</l>
					<l>Of dapple-breasted birds born by the Colchian flood.</l>
					<l>The king and queen, by gracious looks and speech,</l>
					<l>Encourage her, and thus their courtiers teach</l>
					<l>How, this fair morning, they may courtliest be,</l>
					<l>By making Lisa pass it happily.</l>
					<l>And soon the ladies and the barons all</l>
					<l>Draw her by turns, as at a festival</l>
					<l>Made for her sake, to easy, gay discourse,</l>
					<l>And compliment with looks and smiles enforce;</l>
					<l>A joyous hum is heard the gardens round;</l>
					<l>Soon there is Spanish dancing, and the sound</l>
					<l>Of minstrel's song, and autumn fruits are pluckt;</l>
					<l>Till mindfully the king and queen conduct</l>
					<l>Lisa apart to where a trellised shade</l>
					<l>Made pleasant resting. Then King Pedro said,--</l>
					<l>"Excellent maiden, that rich gift of love</l>
					<l>Your heart hath made us hath a worth above</l>
					<l>All royal treasures, nor is fitly met</l>
					<l>Save when the grateful memory of deep debt</l>
					<l>Lies still behind the outward honors done:</l>
					<l>And as a sign that no oblivion</l>
					<l>Shall overflood that faithful memory,</l>
					<l>We while we live your cavalier will be;</l>
					<l>Nor will we ever arm ourselves for fight,</l>
					<l>Whether for struggle dire, or brief delight</l>
					<l>Of warlike feigning, but we first will take</l>
					<l>The colors you ordain, and for your sake</l>
					<l>Charge the more bravely where your emblem is:</l>
					<l>Nor will we claim from you an added bliss</l>
					<l>To our sweet thoughts of you save one sole kiss.</l>
					<l>But there still rests the outward honor meet</l>
					<l>To mark your worthiness; and we entreat</l>
					<l>That you will turn your ear to proffered vows</l>
					<l>Of one who loves you, and would be your spouse</l>
					<l>We must not wrong yourself and Sicily</l>
					<l>By letting all your blooming years pass by</l>
					<l>Unmated: you will give the world its due</l>
					<l>From beauteous maiden, and become a matron true."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Then Lisa, wrapt in virgin wonderment</l>
					<l>At her ambitious love's complete content,</l>
					<l>Which left no further good for her to seek</l>
					<l>Than love's obedience, said, with accent meek,--</l>
					<l>"Monsignor, I know well that were it known</l>
					<l>To all the world how high my love had flown,</l>
					<l>There would be few who would not deem me mad,</l>
					<l>Or say my mind the falsest image had</l>
					<l>Of my condition and your loftiness.</l>
					<l>But Heaven has seen that for no moment's space</l>
					<l>Have I forgotten you to be the king,</l>
					<l>Or me myself to be a lowly thing--</l>
					<l>A little lark, enamoured of the sky,</l>
					<l>That soared to sing, to break its breast, and die.</l>
					<l>But, as you better know than I, the heart</l>
					<l>In choosing chooseth not its own desert,</l>
					<l>But that great merit which attracteth it:</l>
					<l>'Tis law, I struggled, but I must submit,</l>
					<l>And having seen a worth all worth above,</l>
					<l>I loved you, love you, and shall always love.</l>
					<l>But that doth mean, my will is ever yours,</l>
					<l>Not only when your will my good insures,</l>
					<l>But if it wrought me what the world calls harm:</l>
					<l>Fire, wounds, would wear from your dear will a charm.</l>
					<l>That you will be my knight is full content,</l>
					<l>And for that kiss,--I pray, first, for the queen's consent."</l>
					<l>Her answer, given with such firm gentleness,</l>
					<l>Pleased the queen well, and made her hold no less</l>
					<l>Of Lisa's merit than the king had held.</l>
					<l>And so, all cloudy threats of grief dispelled,</l>
					<l>There was betrothal made that very morn</l>
					<l>'Twixt Perdicone, youthful, brave, well-born,</l>
					<l>And Lisa whom he loved; she loving well</l>
					<l>The lot that from obedience befell.</l>
					<l>The queen a rare betrothal ring on each</l>
					<l>Bestowed, and other gems, with gracious speech.</l>
					<l>And, that no joy might lack, the king, who knew</l>
					<l>The youth was poor, gave him rich Ceffalu</l>
					<l>And Cataletta,--large and fruitful lands,--</l>
					<l>Adding much promise when he joined their hands.</l>
					<l>At last he said to Lisa, with an air</l>
					<l>Gallant yet noble, "Now we claim our share</l>
					<l>From your sweet love, a share which is not small;</l>
					<l>For in the sacrament one crumb is all."</l>
					<l>Then, taking her small face his hands between,</l>
					<l>He kissed her on the brow with kiss serene,--</l>
					<l>Fit seal to that pure vision her young soul had seen.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And many witnessed that King Pedro kept</l>
					<l>His royal promise. Perdicone stept</l>
					<l>To many honors honorably won,</l>
					<l>Living with Lisa in true union.</l>
					<l>Throughout his life, the king still took delight</l>
					<l>To call himself fair Lisa's faithful knight;</l>
					<l>And never wore in field or tournament</l>
					<l>A scarf or emblem, save by Lisa sent.</l>
					<l>Such deeds made subjects loyal in that land;</l>
					<l>They joyed that one so worthy to command,</l>
					<l>So chivalrous and gentle, had become</l>
					<l>The king of Sicily, and filled the room</l>
					<l>Of Frenchmen, who abused the Church's trust,</l>
					<l>Till, in a righteous vengeance on their lust,</l>
					<l>Messina rose, with God, and with the dagger's thrust.</l>

					<l>⁠Olympian suffering,</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Had carried his diviner lore</l>

					<l>In thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,</l>
					<l>And with their mild persistence urge man's search</l>
					<l>To vaster issues.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠So to live is heaven:</l>
					<l>To make undying music in the world,</l>
					<l>Breathing as beauteous order that controls</l>
					<l>With growing sway the growing life of man.</l>
					<l>So we inherit that sweet purity</l>
					<l>For which we struggled, failed, and agonized</l>
					<l>With widening retrospect that bred despair.</l>
					<l>Rebellious flesh that would not be subdued,</l>
					<l>A vicious parent shaming still its child</l>
					<l>Poor anxious penitence, is quick dissolved;</l>
					<l>Its discords, quenched by meeting harmonies,</l>
					<l>Die in the large and charitable air.</l>
					<l>And all our rarer, better, truer self,</l>
					<l>That sobbed religiously in yearning song,</l>
					<l>That watched to ease the burden of the world,</l>
					<l>Laboriously tracing what must be,</l>
					<l>And what may yet be better—saw within</l>
					<l>A worthier image for the sanctuary,</l>
					<l>And shaped it forth before the multitude</l>
					<l>Divinely human, raising worship so</l>
					<l>To higher reverence more mixed with love—</l>
					<l>That better self shall live till human Time</l>
					<l>Shall fold its eyelids, and the human sky</l>
					<l>Be gathered like a scroll within the tomb</l>
					<l>Unread forever.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>⁠⁠⁠This is life to come,</l>
					<l>Which martyred men have made more glorious</l>
					<l>For us who strive to follow. May I reach</l>
					<l>That purest heaven, be to other souls</l>
					<l>The cup of strength in some great agony,</l>
					<l>Enkindle generous ardor, feed pure love,</l>
					<l>Beget the smiles that have no cruelty—</l>
					<l>Be the sweet presence of a good diffused,</l>
					<l>And in diffusion ever more intense.</l>
					<l>So shall I join the choir invisible</l>
					<l>Whose music is the gladness of the world.</l>

				<teiSubTitle>The Legend of Jubal</teiSubTitle>
				<lg>
					<l>WHEN Cain was driven from Jehovah's land</l>
					<l>He wandered eastward, seeking some far strand</l>
					<l>Ruled by kind gods who asked no offerings</l>
					<l>Save pure field-fruits, as aromatic things,</l>
					<l>To feed the subtler sense of frames divine</l>
					<l>That lived on fragrance for their food and wine:</l>
					<l>Wild joyous gods, who winked at faults and folly,</l>
					<l>And could be pitiful and melancholy.</l>
					<l>He never had a doubt that such gods were;</l>
					<l>He looked within, and saw them mirrored there.</l>
					<l>Some think he came at last to Tartary,</l>
					<l>And some to Ind; but, howsoe'er it be,</l>
					<l>His staff he planted where sweet waters ran,</l>
					<l>And in that home of Cain the Arts began.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Man's life was spacious in the early world:</l>
					<l>It paused, like some slow ship with sail unfurled</l>
					<l>Waiting in seas by scarce a wavelet curled;</l>
					<l>Beheld the slow star-paces of the skies,</l>
					<l>And grew from strength to strength through centuries;</l>
					<l>Saw infant trees fill out their giant limbs,</l>
					<l>And heard a thousand times the sweet bird's marriage hymns.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>In Cain's young city none had heard of Death</l>
					<l>Save him, the founder; and it was his faith</l>
					<l>That here, away from harsh Jehovah's law,</l>
					<l>Man was immortal, since no halt or flaw</l>
					<l>In Cain's own frame betrayed six hundred years,</l>
					<l>But dark as pines that autumn never sears</l>
					<l>His locks thronged backward as he ran, his frame</l>
					<l>Rose like the orbéd sun each morn the same,</l>
					<l>Lake-mirrored to his gaze; and that red brand,</l>
					<l>The scorching impress of Jehovah's hand,</l>
					<l>Was still clear-edged to his unwearied eye,</l>
					<l>Its secret firm in time-fraught memory.</l>
					<l>He said, "My happy offspring shall not know</l>
					<l>That the red life from out a man may flow</l>
					<l>When smitten by his brother." True, his race</l>
					<l>Bore each one stamped upon his new-born face</l>
					<l>A copy of the brand no whit less clear;</l>
					<l>But every mother held that little copy dear.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus generations in glad idlesse throve,</l>
					<l>Nor hunted prey, nor with each other strove;</l>
					<l>For clearest springs were plenteous in the land,</l>
					<l>And gourds for cups; the ripe fruits sought the hand,</l>
					<l>Bending the laden boughs with fragrant gold;</l>
					<l>And for their roofs and garments wealth untold</l>
					<l>Lay everywhere in grasses and broad leaves:</l>
					<l>They labored gently, as a maid who weaves</l>
					<l>Her hair in mimic mats, and pauses oft</l>
					<l>And strokes across her palm the tresses soft,</l>
					<l>Then peeps to watch the poised butterfly,</l>
					<l>Or little burdened ants that homeward hie.</l>
					<l>Time was but leisure to their lingering thought,</l>
					<l>There was no need for haste to finish aught;</l>
					<l>But sweet beginnings were repeated still</l>
					<l>Like infant babblings that no task fulfil;</l>
					<l>For love, that loved not change, constrained the simple will.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Till, hurling stones in mere athletic joy,</l>
					<l>Strong Lamech struck and killed his fairest boy,</l>
					<l>And tried to wake him with the tenderest cries,</l>
					<l>And fetched and held before the glazed eyes</l>
					<l>The things they best had loved to look upon;</l>
					<l>But never glance or smile or sigh he won.</l>
					<l>The generations stood around those twain</l>
					<l>Helplessly gazing, till their father Cain</l>
					<l>Parted the press, and said, "He will not wake;</l>
					<l>This is the endless sleep, and we must make</l>
					<l>A bed deep down for him beneath the sod;</l>
					<l>For know, my sons, there is a mighty God</l>
					<l>Angry with all man's race, but most with me.</l>
					<l>I fled from out His land in vain!—'t is He</l>
					<l>Who came and slew the lad, for He has found</l>
					<l>This home of ours, and we shall all be bound</l>
					<l>By the harsh bands of His most cruel will,</l>
					<l>Which any moment may some dear one kill.</l>
					<l>Nay, though we live for countless moons, at last</l>
					<l>We and all ours shall die like summers past.</l>
					<l>This is Jehovah's will, and He is strong;</l>
					<l>I thought the way I travelled was too long</l>
					<l>For Him to follow me: my thought was vain!</l>
					<l>He walks unseen, but leaves a track of pain,</l>
					<l>Pale Death His footprint is, and He will come again!"</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And a new spirit from that hour came o'er</l>
					<l>The race of Cain: soft idlesse was no more,</l>
					<l>But even the sunshine had a heart of care,</l>
					<l>Smiling with hidden dread—a mother fair</l>
					<l>Who folding to her breast a dying child</l>
					<l>Beams with feigned joy that but makes sadness mild.</l>
					<l>Death was now lord of Life, and at his word</l>
					<l>Time, vague as air before, new terrors stirred,</l>
					<l>With measured wing now audibly arose</l>
					<l>Throbbing through all things to some unknown close.</l>
					<l>Now glad Content by clutching Haste was torn.</l>
					<l>And Work grew eager, and Device was born.</l>
					<l>It seemed the light was never loved before,</l>
					<l>Now each man said, "'T will go and come no more.'</l>
					<l>No budding branch, no pebble from the brook,</l>
					<l>No form, no shadow, but new dearness took</l>
					<l>From the one thought that life must have an end;</l>
					<l>And the last parting now began to send</l>
					<l>Diffusive dread through love and wedded bliss,</l>
					<l>Thrilling them into finer tenderness.</l>
					<l>Then Memory disclosed her face divine,</l>
					<l>That like the calm nocturnal lights doth shine</l>
					<l>Within the soul, and shows the sacred graves,</l>
					<l>And shows the presence that no sunlight craves,</l>
					<l>No space, no warmth, but moves among them all;</l>
					<l>Gone and yet here, and coming at each call,</l>
					<l>With ready voice and eyes that understand,</l>
					<l>And lips that ask a kiss, and dear responsive hand.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus to Cain's race death was tear-watered seed</l>
					<l>Of various life and action-shaping need.</l>
					<l>But chief the sons of Lamech felt the stings</l>
					<l>Of new ambition, and the force that springs</l>
					<l>In passion beating on the shores of fate.</l>
					<l>They said, "There comes a night when all too late</l>
					<l>The mind shall long to prompt the achieving hand,</l>
					<l>The eager thought behind closed portals stand,</l>
					<l>And the last wishes to the mute lips press</l>
					<l>Buried ere death in silent helplessness.</l>
					<l>Then while the soul its way with sound can cleave,</l>
					<l>And while the arm is strong to strike and heave,</l>
					<l>Let soul and arm give shape that will abide</l>
					<l>And rule above our graves, and power divide</l>
					<l>With that great god of day, whose rays must bend</l>
					<l>As we shall make the moving shadows tend.</l>
					<l>Come, let us fashion acts that are to be,</l>
					<l>When we shall lie in darkness silently,</l>
					<l>As our young brother doth, whom yet we see</l>
					<l>Fallen and slain, but reigning in our will</l>
					<l>By that one image of him pale and still."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>For Lamech's sons were heroes of their race:</l>
					<l>Jabal, the eldest, bore upon his face</l>
					<l>The look of that calm river-god, the Nile,</l>
					<l>Mildly secure in power that needs not guile.</l>
					<l>But Tubal-Cain was restless as the fire</l>
					<l>That glows and spreads and leaps from high to higher</l>
					<l>Where'er is aught to seize or to subdue;</l>
					<l>Strong as a storm he lifted or o'erthrew,</l>
					<l>His urgent limbs like rounded granite grew,</l>
					<l>Such granite as the plunging torrent wears</l>
					<l>And roaring rolls around through countless years.</l>
					<l>But strength that still on movement must be fed,</l>
					<l>Inspiring thought of change, devices bred,</l>
					<l>And urged his mind through earth and air to rove</l>
					<l>For force that he could conquer if he strove,</l>
					<l>For lurking forms that might new tasks fulfil</l>
					<l>And yield unwilling to his stronger will.</l>
					<l>Such Tubal-Cain. But Jubal had a frame</l>
					<l>Fashioned to finer senses, which became</l>
					<l>A yearning for some hidden soul of things,</l>
					<l>Some outward touch complete on inner springs</l>
					<l>That vaguely moving bred a lonely pain,</l>
					<l>A want that did but stronger grow with gain</l>
					<l>Of all good else, as spirits might be sad</l>
					<l>For lack of speech to tell us they are glad.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Now Jabal learned to tame the lowing kine,</l>
					<l>And from their udders drew the snow-white wine</l>
					<l>That stirs the innocent joy, and makes the stream</l>
					<l>Of elemental life with fulness teem;</l>
					<l>The star-browed calves he nursed with feeding hand,</l>
					<l>And sheltered them, till all the little band</l>
					<l>Stood mustered gazing at the sunset way</l>
					<l>Whence he would come with store at close of day.</l>
					<l>He soothed the silly sheep with friendly tone</l>
					<l>And reared their staggering lambs that, older grown,</l>
					<l>Followed his steps with sense-taught memory;</l>
					<l>Till he, their shepherd, could their leader be</l>
					<l>And guide them through the pastures as he would,</l>
					<l>With sway that grew from ministry of good.</l>
					<l>He spread his tents upon the grassy plain</l>
					<l>Which, eastward widening like the open main,</l>
					<l>Showed the first whiteness 'neath the morning star;</l>
					<l>Near him his sister, deft, as women are,</l>
					<l>Plied her quick skill in sequence to his thought</l>
					<l>Till the hid treasures of the milk she caught</l>
					<l>Revealed like pollen 'mid the petals white,</l>
					<l>The golden pollen, virgin to the light.</l>
					<l>Even the she-wolf with young, on rapine bent,</l>
					<l>He caught and tethered in his mat-walled tent,</l>
					<l>And cherished all her little sharp-nosed young</l>
					<l>Till the small race with hope and terror clung</l>
					<l>About his footsteps, till each new-reared brood,</l>
					<l>Remoter from the memories of the wood,</l>
					<l>More glad discerned their common home with man.</l>
					<l>This was the work of Jabal: he began</l>
					<l>The pastoral life, and, sire of joys to be.</l>
					<l>Spread the sweet ties that bind the family</l>
					<l>O'er dear dumb souls that thrilled at man's caress,</l>
					<l>And shared his pains with patient helpfulness.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>But Tubal-Cain had caught and yoked the fire.</l>
					<l>Yoked it with stones that bent the flaming spire</l>
					<l>And made it roar in prisoned servitude</l>
					<l>Within the furnace, till with force subdued</l>
					<l>It changed all forms he willed to work upon,</l>
					<l>Till hard from soft, and soft from hard, he won.</l>
					<l>The pliant clay he moulded as he would,</l>
					<l>And laughed with joy when 'mid the heat it stood</l>
					<l>Shaped as his hand had chosen, while the mass</l>
					<l>That from his hold, dark, obstinate, would pass,</l>
					<l>He drew all glowing from the busy heat,</l>
					<l>All breathing as with life that he could beat</l>
					<l>With thundering hammer, making it obey</l>
					<l>His will creative, like the pale soft clay.</l>
					<l>Each day he wrought and better than he planned,</l>
					<l>Shape breeding shape beneath his restless hand.</l>
					<l>(The soul without still helps the soul within,</l>
					<l>And its deft magic ends what we begin.)</l>
					<l>Nay, in his dreams his hammer he would wield</l>
					<l>And seem to see a myriad types revealed.</l>
					<l>Then spring with wondering triumphant cry.</l>
					<l>And, lest the inspiring vision should go by,</l>
					<l>Would rush to labor with that plastic zeal</l>
					<l>Which all the passion of our life can steal</l>
					<l>For force to work with. Each day saw the birth</l>
					<l>Of various forms which, flung upon the earth,</l>
					<l>Seemed harmless toys to cheat the exacting hour,</l>
					<l>But were as seeds instinct with hidden power.</l>
					<l>The axe, the club, the spikéd wheel, the chain,</l>
					<l>Held silently the shrieks and moans of pain;</l>
					<l>And near them latent lay in share and spade,</l>
					<l>In the strong bar, the saw, and deep-curved blade,</l>
					<l>Glad voices of the hearth and harvest-home,</l>
					<l>The social good, and all earth's joy to come.</l>
					<l>Thus to mixed ends wrought Tubal; and they say,</l>
					<l>Some things he made have lasted to this day;</l>
					<l>As, thirty silver pieces that were found</l>
					<l>By Noah's children buried in the ground.</l>
					<l>He made them from mere hunger of device,</l>
					<l>Those small white disks; but they became the price</l>
					<l>The traitor Judas sold his Master for;</l>
					<l>And men still handling them in peace and war</l>
					<l>Catch foul disease, that comes as appetite,</l>
					<l>And lurks and clings as withering, damning blight.</l>
					<l>But Tubal-Cain wot not of treachery,</l>
					<l>Nor greedy lust, nor any ill to be,</l>
					<l>Save the one ill of sinking into naught,</l>
					<l>Banished from action and act-shaping thought.</l>
					<l>He was the sire of swift-transforming skill,</l>
					<l>Which arms for conquest man's ambitious will;</l>
					<l>And round him gladly, as his hammer rung,</l>
					<l>Gathered the elders and the growing young:</l>
					<l>These handled vaguely and those plied the tools,</l>
					<l>Till, happy chance begetting conscious rules,</l>
					<l>The home of Cain with industry was rife,</l>
					<l>And glimpses of a strong persistent life,</l>
					<l>Panting through generations as one breath,</l>
					<l>And filling with its soul the blank of death.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Jubal, too, watched the hammer, till his eyes,</l>
					<l>No longer following its fall or rise,</l>
					<l>Seemed glad with something that they could not see,</l>
					<l>But only listened to—some melody,</l>
					<l>Wherein dumb longings inward speech had found,</l>
					<l>Won from the common store of struggling sound.</l>
					<l>Then, as the metal shapes more various grew,</l>
					<l>And, hurled upon each other, resonance drew,</l>
					<l>Each gave new tones, the revelations dim</l>
					<l>Of some external soul that spoke for him:</l>
					<l>The hollow vessel's clang, the clash, the boom,</l>
					<l>Like light that makes wide spiritual room</l>
					<l>And skyey spaces in the spaceless thought,</l>
					<l>To Jubal such enlargéd passion brought</l>
					<l>That love, hope, rage, and all experience,</l>
					<l>Were fused in vaster being, fetching thence</l>
					<l>Concords and discords, cadences and cries</l>
					<l>That seemed from some world-shrouded soul to rise,</l>
					<l>Some rapture more intense, some mightier rage,</l>
					<l>Some living sea that burst the bounds of man's brief age.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Then with such blissful trouble and glad care</l>
					<l>For growth within unborn as mothers bear,</l>
					<l>To the far woods he wandered, listening,</l>
					<l>And heard the birds their little stories sing</l>
					<l>In notes whose rise and fall seemed melted speech—</l>
					<l>Melted with tears, smiles, glances—that can reach</l>
					<l>More quickly through our frame's deep-winding night,</l>
					<l>And without thought raise thought's best fruit, delight.</l>
					<l>Pondering, he sought his home again and heard</l>
					<l>The fluctuant changes of the spoken word:</l>
					<l>The deep remonstrance and the argued want,</l>
					<l>Insistent first in close monotonous chant,</l>
					<l>Next leaping upward to defiant stand</l>
					<l>Or downward beating like the resolute hand;</l>
					<l>The mother's call, the children's answering cry,</l>
					<l>The laugh's light cataract tumbling from on high;</l>
					<l>The suasive repetitions Jabal taught,</l>
					<l>That timid browsing cattle homeward brought;</l>
					<l>The clear-winged fugue of echoes vanishing;</l>
					<l>And through them all the hammer's rhythmic ring.</l>
					<l>Jubal sat lonely, all around was dim,</l>
					<l>Yet his face glowed with light revealed to him:</l>
					<l>For as the delicate stream of odor wakes</l>
					<l>The thought-wed sentience and some image makes</l>
					<l>From out the mingled fragments of the past,</l>
					<l>Finely compact in wholeness that will last,</l>
					<l>So streamed as from the body of each sound</l>
					<l>Subtler pulsations, swift as warmth, which found</l>
					<l>All prisoned germs and all their powers unbound,</l>
					<l>Till thought self-luminous flamed from memory,</l>
					<l>And in creative vision wandered free.</l>
					<l>Then Jubal, standing, rapturous arms upraised.</l>
					<l>And on the dark with eager eyes he gazed,</l>
					<l>As had some manifested god been there.</l>
					<l>It was his thought he saw: the presence fair</l>
					<l>Of unachieved achievement, the high task,</l>
					<l>The struggling unborn spirit that doth ask</l>
					<l>With irresistible cry for blood and breath,</l>
					<l>Till feeding its great life we sink in death.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>He said, "Were now those mighty tones and cries</l>
					<l>That from the giant soul of earth arise,</l>
					<l>Those groans of some great travail heard from far,</l>
					<l>Some power at wrestle with the things that are,</l>
					<l>Those sounds which vary with the varying form</l>
					<l>Of clay and metal, and in sightless swarm</l>
					<l>Fill the wide space with tremors: were these wed</l>
					<l>To human voices with such passion fed</l>
					<l>As does put glimmer in our common speech,</l>
					<l>But might flame out in tones whose changing reach,</l>
					<l>Surpassing meagre need, informs the sense</l>
					<l>With fuller union, finer difference—</l>
					<l>Were this great vision, now obscurely bright</l>
					<l>As morning hills that melt in new-poured light,</l>
					<l>Wrought into solid form and living sound,</l>
					<l>Moving with ordered throb and sure rebound,</l>
					<l>Then—Nay, I Jubal will that work begin!</l>
					<l>The generations of our race shall win</l>
					<l>New life, that grows from out the heart of this,</l>
					<l>As spring from winter, or as lovers' bliss</l>
					<l>From out the dull unknown of unwaked energies."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus he resolved, and in the soul-fed light</l>
					<l>Of coming ages waited through the night,</l>
					<l>Watching for that near dawn whose chiller ray</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The poems of George Eliot 1884 plate facing p293.png</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"Then Jubal poured his triumph in a song."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Showed but the unchanged world of yesterday;</l>
					<l>Where all the order of his dream divine</l>
					<l>Lay like Olympian forms within the mine;</l>
					<l>Where fervor that could fill the earthly round</l>
					<l>With throngéd joys of form-begotten sound</l>
					<l>Must shrink intense within the patient power</l>
					<l>That lonely labors through the niggard hour.</l>
					<l>Such patience have the heroes who begin,</l>
					<l>Sailing the first to lands which others win.</l>
					<l>Jubal must dare as great beginners dare,</l>
					<l>Strike form's first way in matter rude and bare,</l>
					<l>And, yearning vaguely toward the plenteous quire</l>
					<l>Of the world's harvest, make one poor small lyre.</l>
					<l>He made it, and from out its measured frame</l>
					<l>Drew the harmonic soul, whose answers came</l>
					<l>With guidance sweet and lessons of delight</l>
					<l>Teaching to ear and hand the blissful Right,</l>
					<l>Where strictest law is gladness to the sense</l>
					<l>And all desire bends toward obedience.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Then Jubal poured his triumph in a song—</l>
					<l>The rapturous word that rapturous notes prolong</l>
					<l>As radiance streams from smallest things that burn,</l>
					<l>Or thought of loving into love doth turn.</l>
					<l>And still his lyre gave companionship</l>
					<l>In sense-taught concert as of lip with lip.</l>
					<l>Alone amid the hills at first he tried</l>
					<l>His wingéd song; then with adoring pride</l>
					<l>And bridegroom's joy at leading forth his bride,</l>
					<l>He said, "This wonder which my soul hath found,</l>
					<l>This heart of music in the might of sound,</l>
					<l>Shall forthwith be the share of all our race</l>
					<l>And like the morning gladden common space:</l>
					<l>The song shall spread and swell as rivers do,</l>
					<l>And I will teach our youth with skill to woo</l>
					<l>This living lyre, to know its secret will,</l>
					<l>Its fine division of the good and ill.</l>
					<l>So shall men call me sire of harmony.</l>
					<l>And where great Song is, there my life shall be."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Thus glorying as a god beneficent,</l>
					<l>Forth from his solitary joy he went</l>
					<l>To bless mankind. It was at evening,</l>
					<l>When shadows lengthen from each westward thing,</l>
					<l>When imminence of change makes sense more fine</l>
					<l>And light seems holier in its grand decline.</l>
					<l>The fruit-trees wore their studded coronal,</l>
					<l>Earth and her children were at festival,</l>
					<l>Glowing as with one heart and one consent—</l>
					<l>Thought, love, trees, rocks, in sweet warm radiance blent.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The tribe of Cain was resting on the ground,</l>
					<l>The various ages wreathed in one broad round.</l>
					<l>Here lay, while children peeped o'er his huge thighs,</l>
					<l>The sinewy man embrowned by centuries;</l>
					<l>Here the broad-bosomed mother of the strong</l>
					<l>Looked, like Demeter, placid o'er the throng</l>
					<l>Of young lithe forms whose rest was movement too—</l>
					<l>Tricks, prattle, nods, and laughs that lightly flew,</l>
					<l>And swayings as of flower-beds where Love blew.</l>
					<l>For all had feasted well upon the flesh</l>
					<l>Of juicy fruits, on nuts, and honey fresh,</l>
					<l>And now their wine was health-bred merriment,</l>
					<l>Which through the generations circling went,</l>
					<l>Leaving none sad, for even father Cain</l>
					<l>Smiled as a Titan might, despising pain.</l>
					<l>Jabal sat climbed on by a playful ring</l>
					<l>Of children, lambs, and whelps, whose gambolling,</l>
					<l>With tiny hoofs, paws, hands, and dimpled feet,</l>
					<l>Made barks, bleats, laughs, in pretty hubbub meet.</l>
					<l>But Tubal's hammer rang from far away,</l>
					<l>Tubal alone would keep no holiday,</l>
					<l>His furnace must not slack for any feast,</l>
					<l>For of all hardship work he counted least;</l>
					<l>He scorned all rest but sleep, where every dream</l>
					<l>Made his repose more potent action seem.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Yet with health's nectar some strange thirst was blent,</l>
					<l>The fateful growth, the unnamed discontent,</l>
					<l>The inward shaping toward some unborn power,</l>
					<l>Some deeper-breathing act, the being's flower.</l>
					<l>After all gestures, words, and speech of eyes,</l>
					<l>The soul had more to tell, and broke in sighs.</l>
					<l>Then from the east, with glory on his head</l>
					<l>Such as low-slanting beams on corn-waves spread,</l>
					<l>Came Jubal with his lyre: there 'mid the throng,</l>
					<l>Where the blank space was, poured a solemn song,</l>
					<l>Touching his lyre to full harmonic throb</l>
					<l>And measured pulse, with cadences that sob,</l>
					<l>Exult and cry, and search the inmost deep</l>
					<l>Where the dark sources of new passion sleep.</l>
					<l>Joy took the air, and took each breathing soul,</l>
					<l>Embracing them in one entrancéd whole,</l>
					<l>Yet thrilled each varying frame to various ends,</l>
					<l>As Spring new-waking through the creature sends</l>
					<l>Or rage or tenderness; more plenteous life</l>
					<l>Here breeding dread, and there a fiercer strife.</l>
					<l>He who had lived through twice three centuries,</l>
					<l>Whose months monotonous, like trees on trees,</l>
					<l>In hoary forests, stretched a backward maze,</l>
					<l>Dreamed himself dimly through the travelled days</l>
					<l>Till in clear light he paused, and felt the sun</l>
					<l>That warmed him when he was a little one;</l>
					<l>Felt that true heaven, the recovered past,</l>
					<l>The dear small Known amid the Unknown vast,</l>
					<l>And in that heaven wept. But younger limbs</l>
					<l>Thrilled toward the future, that bright land which swims</l>
					<l>In western glory, isles and streams and bays,</l>
					<l>Where hidden pleasures float in golden haze.</l>
					<l>And in all these the rhythmic influence,</l>
					<l>Sweetly o'ercharging the delighted sense,</l>
					<l>Flowed out in movements, little waves that spread</l>
					<l>Enlarging, till in tidal union led</l>
					<l>The youths and maidens both alike long-tressed,</l>
					<l>By grace-inspiring melody possessed,</l>
					<l>Rose in slow dance, with beauteous floating swerve</l>
					<l>Of limbs and hair, and many a melting curve</l>
					<l>Of ringéd feet swayed by each close-linked palm:</l>
					<l>Then Jubal poured more rapture in his psalm.</l>
					<l>The dance fired music, music fired the dance,</l>
					<l>The glow diffusive lit each countenance,</l>
					<l>Till all the gazing elders rose and stood</l>
					<l>With glad yet awful shock of that mysterious good.</l>
					<l>Even Tubal caught the sound, and wondering came,</l>
					<l>Urging his sooty bulk like smoke-wrapt flame</l>
					<l>Till he could see his brother with the lyre,</l>
					<l>The work for which he lent his furnace-fire</l>
					<l>And diligent hammer, witting naught of this—</l>
					<l>This power in metal shape which made strange bliss,</l>
					<l>Entering within him like a dream full-fraught</l>
					<l>With new creations finished in a thought.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The sun had sunk, but music still was there,</l>
					<l>And when this ceased, still triumph filled the air:</l>
					<l>It seemed the stars were shining with delight</l>
					<l>And that no night was ever like this night.</l>
					<l>All clung with praise to Jubal: some besought</l>
					<l>That he would teach them his new skill; some caught,</l>
					<l>Swiftly as smiles are caught in looks that meet,</l>
					<l>The tone's melodic change and rhythmic beat:</l>
					<l>'T was easy following where invention trod—</l>
					<l>All eyes can see when light flows out from God.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And thus did Jubal to his race reveal</l>
					<l>Music their larger soul, where woe and weal</l>
					<l>Filling the resonant chords, the song, the dance,</l>
					<l>Moved with a wider-winged utterance.</l>
					<l>Now many a lyre was fashioned, many a song</l>
					<l>Raised echoes new, old echoes to prolong,</l>
					<l>Till things of Jubal's making were so rife,</l>
					<l>"Hearing myself," he said, "hems in my life,</l>
					<l>And I will get me to some far-off land,</l>
					<l>Where higher mountains under heaven stand</l>
					<l>And touch the blue at rising of the stars,</l>
					<l>Whose song they hear where no rough mingling mars</l>
					<l>The great clear voices. Such lands there must be,</l>
					<l>Where varying forms make varying symphony—</l>
					<l>Where other thunders roll amid the hills,</l>
					<l>Some mightier wind a mightier forest fills</l>
					<l>With other strains through other-shapen boughs;</l>
					<l>Where bees and birds and beasts that hunt or browse</l>
					<l>Will teach me songs I know not. Listening there,</l>
					<l>My life shall grow like trees both tall and fair</l>
					<l>That rise and spread and bloom toward fuller fruit each year."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>He took a raft, and travelled with the stream</l>
					<l>Southward for many a league, till he might deem</l>
					<l>He saw at last the pillars of the sky,</l>
					<l>Beholding mountains whose white majesty</l>
					<l>Rushed through him as new awe, and made new song</l>
					<l>That swept with fuller wave the chords along,</l>
					<l>Weighting his voice with deep religious chime,</l>
					<l>The iteration of slow chant sublime.</l>
					<l>It was the region long inhabited</l>
					<l>By all the race of Seth; and Jubal said:</l>
					<l>"Here have I found my thirsty soul's desire,</l>
					<l>Eastward the hills touch heaven, and evening's fire</l>
					<l>Flames through deep waters; I will take my rest,</l>
					<l>And feed anew from my great mother's breast,</l>
					<l>The sky-clasped Earth, whose voices nurture me</l>
					<l>As the flowers' sweetness doth the honey-bee."</l>
					<l>He lingered wandering for many an age,</l>
					<l>And, sowing music, made high heritage</l>
					<l>For generations far beyond the Flood—</l>
					<l>For the poor late-begotten human brood</l>
					<l>Born to life's weary brevity and perilous good.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And ever as he travelled he would climb</l>
					<l>The farthest mountain, yet the heavenly chime,</l>
					<l>The mighty tolling of the far-off spheres</l>
					<l>Beating their pathway, never touched his ears.</l>
					<l>But wheresoe'er he rose the heavens rose,</l>
					<l>And the far-gazing mountain could disclose</l>
					<l>Naught but a wider earth; until one height</l>
					<l>Showed him the ocean stretched in liquid light,</l>
					<l>And he could hear its multitudinous roar,</l>
					<l>Its plunge and hiss upon the pebbled shore:</l>
					<l>Then Jubal silent sat, and touched his lyre no more.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>He thought, "The world is great, but I am weak,</l>
					<l>And where the sky bends is no solid peak</l>
					<l>To give me footing, but instead, this main —</l>
					<l>Myriads of maddened horses thundering o'er the plain.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"New voices come to me where'er I roam,</l>
					<l>My heart too widens with its widening home:</l>
					<l>But song grows weaker, and the heart must break</l>
					<l>For lack of voice, or fingers that can wake</l>
					<l>The lyre's full answer; nay, its chords were all</l>
					<l>Too few to meet the growing spirit's call.</l>
					<l>The former songs seem little, yet no more</l>
					<l>Can soul, hand, voice, with interchanging lore</l>
					<l>Tell what the earth is saying unto me:</l>
					<l>The secret is too great, I hear confusedly.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"No farther will I travel: once again</l>
					<l>My brethren I will see, and that fair plain</l>
					<l>Where I and Song were born. There fresh-voiced youth</l>
					<l>Will pour my strains with all the early truth</l>
					<l>Which now abides not in my voice and hands,</l>
					<l>But only in the soul, the will that stands</l>
					<l>Helpless to move. My tribe remembering</l>
					<l>Will cry ''T is he!' and run to greet me, welcoming."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The way was weary. Many a date-palm grew,</l>
					<l>And shook out clustered gold against the blue,</l>
					<l>While Jubal, guided by the steadfast spheres,</l>
					<l>Sought the dear home of those first eager years,</l>
					<l>When, with fresh vision fed, the fuller will</l>
					<l>Took living outward shape in pliant skill;</l>
					<l>For still he hoped to find the former things,</l>
					<l>And the warm gladness recognition brings.</l>
					<l>His footsteps erred among the mazy woods</l>
					<l>And long illusive sameness of the floods,</l>
					<l>Winding and wandering. Through far regions, strange</l>
					<l>With Gentile homes and faces, did he range,</l>
					<l>And left his music in their memory,</l>
					<l>And left at last, when naught besides would free</l>
					<l>His homeward steps from clinging hands and cries,</l>
					<l>The ancient lyre. And now in ignorant eyes</l>
					<l>No sign remained of Jubal, Lamech's son,</l>
					<l>That mortal frame wherein was first begun</l>
					<l>The immortal life of song. His withered brow</l>
					<l>Pressed over eyes that held no lightning now,</l>
					<l>His locks streamed whiteness on the hurrying air,</l>
					<l>The unresting soul had worn itself quite bare</l>
					<l>Of beauteous token, as the outworn might</l>
					<l>Of oaks slow dying, gaunt in summer's light.</l>
					<l>His full deep voice toward thinnest treble ran:</l>
					<l>He was the rune-writ story of a man.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>And so at last he neared the well-known land,</l>
					<l>Could see the hills in ancient order stand</l>
					<l>With friendly faces whose familiar gaze</l>
					<l>Looked through the sunshine of his childish days;</l>
					<l>Knew the deep-shadowed folds of hanging woods,</l>
					<l>And seemed to see the selfsame insect broods</l>
					<l>Whirling and quivering o'er the flowers—to hear</l>
					<l>The selfsame cuckoo making distance near.</l>
					<l>Yea, the dear Earth, with mother's constancy,</l>
					<l>Met and embraced him, and said, "Thou art he!</l>
					<l>This was thy cradle, here my breast was thine,</l>
					<l>Where feeding, thou didst all thy life entwine</l>
					<l>With my sky-wedded life in heritage divine."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>But wending ever through the watered plain,</l>
					<l>Firm not to rest save in the home of Cain,</l>
					<l>He saw dread Change, with dubious face and cold</l>
					<l>That never kept a welcome for the old,</l>
					<l>Like some strange heir upon the hearth, arise</l>
					<l>Saying, "This home is mine." He thought his eyes</l>
					<l>Mocked all deep memories, as things new made,</l>
					<l>Usurping sense, make old things shrink and fade</l>
					<l>And seem ashamed to meet the staring day.</l>
					<l>His memory saw a small foot-trodden way,</l>
					<l>His eyes a broad far-stretching paven road</l>
					<l>Bordered with many a tomb and fair abode;</l>
					<l>The little city that once nestled low</l>
					<l>As buzzing groups about some central glow,</l>
					<l>Spread like a murmuring crowd o'er plain and steep,</l>
					<l>Or monster huge in heavy-breathing sleep.</l>
					<l>His heart grew faint, and tremblingly he sank</l>
					<l>Close by the wayside on a weed-grown bank,</l>
					<l>Not far from where a new-raised temple stood,</l>
					<l>Sky-roofed, and fragrant with wrought cedar wood.</l>
					<l>The morning sun was high; his rays fell hot</l>
					<l>On this hap-chosen, dusty, common spot,</l>
					<l>On the dry-withered grass and withered man:</l>
					<l>That wondrous frame where melody began</l>
					<l>Lay as a tomb defaced that no eye cared to scan.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>But while he sank far music reached his ear.</l>
					<l>He listened until wonder silenced fear</l>
					<l>And gladness wonder; for the broadening stream</l>
					<l>Of sound advancing was his early dream,</l>
					<l>Brought like fulfilment of forgotten prayer;</l>
					<l>As if his soul, breathed out upon the air,</l>
					<l>Had held the invisible seeds of harmony</l>
					<l>Quick with the various strains of life to be.</l>
					<l>He listened: the sweet mingled difference</l>
					<l>With charm alternate took the meeting sense;</l>
					<l>Then bursting like some shield-broad lily red,</l>
					<l>Sudden and near the trumpet's notes outspread,</l>
					<l>And soon his eyes could see the metal flower.</l>
					<l>Shining upturned, out on the morning pour</l>
					<l>Its incense audible; could see a train</l>
					<l>From out the street slow-winding on the plain</l>
					<l>With lyres and cymbals, flutes and psalteries,</l>
					<l>While men, youths, maids, in concert sang to these</l>
					<l>With various throat, or in succession poured,</l>
					<l>Or in full volume mingled. But one word</l>
					<l>Ruled each recurrent rise and answering fall,</l>
					<l>As when the multitudes adoring call</l>
					<l>On some great name divine, their common soul,</l>
					<l>The common need, love, joy, that knits them in one whole.</l>
					<l>The word was "Jubal!" … "Jubal" filled the air</l>
					<l>And seemed to ride aloft, a spirit there,</l>
					<l>Creator of the quire, the full-fraught strain</l>
					<l>That grateful rolled itself to him again.</l>
					<l>The aged man adust upon the bank—</l>
					<l>Whom no eye saw—at first with rapture drank</l>
					<l>The bliss of music, then, with swelling heart,</l>
					<l>Felt, this was his own being's greater part,</l>
					<l>The universal joy once born in him.</l>
					<l>But when the train, with living face and limb</l>
					<l>And vocal breath, came nearer and more near,</l>
					<l>The longing grew that they should hold him dear;</l>
					<l>Him, Lamech's son, whom all their fathers knew,</l>
					<l>The breathing Jubal—him, to whom their love was due.</l>
					<l>All was forgotten but the burning need</l>
					<l>To claim his fuller self, to claim the deed</l>
					<l>That lived away from him, and grew apart,</l>
					<l>While he as from a tomb, with lonely heart,</l>
					<l>Warmed by no meeting glance, no hand that pressed,</l>
					<l>Lay chill amid the life his life had blessed.</l>
					<l>What though his song should spread from man's small race</l>
					<l>Out through the myriad worlds that people space.</l>
					<l>And make the heavens one joy-diffusing quire?—</l>
					<l>Still 'mid that vast would throb the keen desire</l>
					<l>Of this poor aged flesh, this eventide,</l>
					<l>This twilight soon in darkness to subside,</l>
					<l>This little pulse of self that, having glowed</l>
					<l>Through thrice three centuries, and divinely strowed</l>
					<l>The light of music through the vague of sound,</l>
					<l>Ached with its smallness still in good that had no bound.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>For no eye saw him, while with loving pride</l>
					<l>Each voice with each in praise of Jubal vied.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>

				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"He sought the screen</l>
					<l>Of thorny thickets, and there fell unseen."</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>Must lie in conscious trance, dumb, helpless lie</l>
					<l>While all that ardent kindred passed him by?</l>
					<l>His flesh cried out to live with living men</l>
					<l>And join that soul which to the inward ken</l>
					<l>Of all the hymning train was present there.</l>
					<l>Strong passion's daring sees not aught to dare:</l>
					<l>The frost-locked starkness of his frame low-bent,</l>
					<l>His voice's penury of tones long spent,</l>
					<l>He felt not; all his being leaped in flame</l>
					<l>To meet his kindred as they onward came</l>
					<l>Slackening and wheeling toward the temple's face:</l>
					<l>He rushed before them to the glittering space.</l>
					<l>And, with a strength that was but strong desire,</l>
					<l>Cried, "I am Jubal, I! … I made the lyre!"</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The tones amid a lake of silence fell</l>
					<l>Broken and strained, as if a feeble bell</l>
					<l>Had tuneless pealed the triumph of a land</l>
					<l>To listening crowds in expectation spanned.</l>
					<l>Sudden came showers of laughter on that lake;</l>
					<l>They spread along the train from front to wake</l>
					<l>In one great storm of merriment, while he</l>
					<l>Shrank doubting whether he could Jubal be,</l>
					<l>And not a dream of Jubal, whose rich vein</l>
					<l>Of passionate music came with that dream-pain</l>
					<l>Wherein the sense slips off from each loved thing</l>
					<l>And all appearance is mere vanishing.</l>
					<l>But ere the laughter died from out the rear,</l>
					<l>Anger in front saw profanation near;</l>
					<l>Jubal was but a name in each man's faith</l>
					<l>For glorious power untouched by that slow death</l>
					<l>Which creeps with creeping time; this too, the spot,</l>
					<l>And this the day, it must be crime to blot.</l>
					<l>Even with scoffing at a madman's lie:</l>
					<l>Jubal was not a name to wed with mockery.</l>
					<l>Two rushed upon him: two, the most devout</l>
					<l>In honor of great Jubal, thrust him out,</l>
					<l>And beat him with their flutes. 'T was little need;</l>
					<l>He strove not, cried not, but with tottering speed,</l>
					<l>As if the scorn and howls were driving wind</l>
					<l>That urged his body, serving so the mind</l>
					<l>Which could but shrink and yearn, he sought the screen</l>
					<l>Of thorny thickets, and there fell unseen.</l>
					<l>The immortal name of Jubal filled the sky,</l>
					<l>While Jubal lonely laid him down to die.</l>
					<l>He said within his soul, "This is the end:</l>
					<l>O'er all the earth to where the heavens bend</l>
					<l>And hem men's travel, I have breathed my soul:</l>
					<l>I lie here now the remnant of that whole,</l>
					<l>The embers of a life, a lonely pain;</l>
					<l>As far-off rivers to my thirst were vain,</l>
					<l>So of my mighty years naught comes to me again.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"Is the day sinking? Softest coolness springs</l>
					<l>From something round me: dewy shadowy wings</l>
					<l>Enclose me all around—no, not above—</l>
					<l>Is moonlight there? I see a face of love,</l>
					<l>Fair as sweet music when my heart was strong:</l>
					<l>Yea—art thou come again to me, great Song?"</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>The face bent over him like silver night</l>
					<l>In long-remembered summers; that calm light</l>
					<l>Of days which shine in firmaments of thought,</l>
					<l>That past unchangeable, from change still wrought.</l>
					<l>And gentlest tones were with the vision blent:</l>
					<l>He knew not if that gaze the music sent,</l>
					<l>Or music that calm gaze: to hear, to see,</l>
					<l>Was but one undivided ecstasy:</l>
					<l>The raptured senses melted into one,</l>
					<l>And parting life a moment's freedom won</l>
					<l>From in and outer, as a little child</l>
					<l>Sits on a bank and sees blue heavens mild</l>
					<l>Down in the water, and forgets its limbs,</l>
					<l>And knoweth naught save the blue heaven that swims.</l>
				</lg>
				<lg>
					<l>"Jubal," the face said, "I am thy loved Past,</l>
					<l>The soul that makes thee one from first to last.</l>
					<l>I am the angel of thy life and death,</l>
					<l>Thy outbreathed being drawing its last breath.</l>
					<l>Am I not thine alone, a dear dead bride</l>
					<l>Who blest thy lot above all men's beside?</l>
					<l>Thy bride whom thou wouldst never change, nor take</l>

					<l>In central heaven, hadst thou been still the same?</l>
					<l>Wouldst thou have asked aught else from any god—</l>
					<l>Whether with gleaming feet on earth he trod</l>
					<l>Or thundered through the skies—aught else for share</l>
					<l>Of mortal good, than in thy soul to bear</l>
					<l>The growth of song, and feel the sweet unrest</l>
					<l>Of the world's spring-tide in thy conscious breast?</l>
					<l>No, thou hadst grasped thy lot with all its pain,</l>
					<l>Nor loosed it any painless lot to gain</l>
					<l>Where music's voice was silent; for thy fate</l>
					<l>Was human music's self incorporate:</l>
					<l>Thy senses' keenness and thy passionate strife</l>
					<l>Were flesh of her flesh and her womb of life.</l>
					<l>And greatly hast thou lived, for not alone</l>
					<l>With hidden raptures were her secrets shown,</l>
					<l>Buried within thee, as the purple light</l>
					<l>Of gems may sleep in solitary night;</l>
					<l>But thy expanding joy was still to give,</l>
					<l>And with the generous air in song to live,</l>
					<l>Feeding the wave of ever-widening bliss</l>
					<l>Where fellowship means equal perfectness.</l>
					<l>And on the mountains in thy wandering</l>
					<l>Thy feet were beautiful as blossomed spring,</l>
					<l>That turns the leafless wood to love's glad home,</l>
					<l>For with thy coming Melody was come.</l>
					<l>This was thy lot, to feel, create, bestow,</l>
					<l>And that immeasurable life to know</l>
					<l>From which the fleshly self falls shrivelled, dead,</l>
					<l>A seed primeval that has forests bred.</l>
					<l>It is the glory of the heritage</l>
					<l>Thy life has left, that makes thy outcast age:</l>
					<l>Thy limbs shall lie dark, tombless on this sod,</l>
					<l>Because thou shinest in man's soul, a god,</l>
					<l>Who found and gave new passion and new joy</l>
					<l>That naught but Earth's destruction can destroy.</l>
					<l>Thy gifts to give was thine of men alone:</l>
					<l>'T was but in giving that thou couldst atone</l>
					<l>For too much wealth amid their poverty."</l>

					<l>The words seemed melting into symphony.</l>
					<l>The wings upbore him, and the gazing song</l>
					<l>Was floating him the heavenly space along,</l>
					<l>Where mighty harmonies all gently fell</l>
					<l>Through veiling vastness, like the far-off bell,</l>
					<l>Till, ever onward through the choral blue,</l>
					<l>He heard more faintly and more faintly knew,</l>
					<l>Quitting mortality, a quenched sun-wave,</l>
					<l>The All-creating Presence for his grave.</l>

						<l>By her who took the second—she was roused. </l>

						<l>Without that voice for channel to her soul</l>
						<l>She says, it must have leaped through all her limbs—</l>
						<l>Made her a Maenad—made her snatch a brand </l>
						<l>And fire some forest, that her rage might mount </l>
						<l>In crashing roaring flames through half a land, </l>
						<l>Leaving her still and patient for a while.</l>
						<l>“Poor wretch!” she says, of any murderess—</l>

						<l>She walked like Orpheus in his solitude,</l>
						<l>And seemed to see nought but what no man saw. </l>
						<l>'Twas famous. Not the Schroeder-Devrient</l>

						<l>Well! The first notes came clearly firmly forth. </l>
						<l>And I was easy, for behind those rills</l>
						<l>I knew there was a fountain. I could see</l>
						<l>The house was breathing gently, heads were still; </l>
						<l>Parrot opinion was struck meekly mute,</l>
						<l>And human hearts were swelling. Armgart stood</l>
						<l>As if she had been new-created there</l>
						<l>And found her voice which found a melody.</l>
						<l>The minx! Gluck had not written, nor I taught: </l>
						<l>Orpheus was Armgart, Armgart Orpheus.</l>
						<l>Well, well, all through the scena I could feel </l>
						<l>The silence tremble now, now poise itself </l>
						<l>With added weight of feeling, till at last </l>
						<l>Delight o'er-toppled it. The final note</l>
						<l>Had happy drowning in the unloosed roar </l>
						<l>That surged and ebbed and ever surged again, </l>
						<l>Till expectation kept it pent awhile</l>
						<l>Ere Orpheus returned. Pfui! He was changed:</l>
						<l>My demi-god was pale, had downcast eyes</l>

						<l>Falling like shattered rainbows all around— </l>
						<l>Think you I felt myself a prima donna?</l>
						<l>No, but a happy spiritual star</l>
						<l>Such as old Dante saw, wrought in a rose</l>
						<l>Of light in Paradise, whose only self</l>

					</lg>

						<l>Think much to let my horses draw me home,</l>

						<l>Pretend to seek obscurity—to sing</l>
						<l>In hope of disregard? A vile pretence!</l>

						<l>Armgart, to many minds the first success</l>
						<l>Is reason for desisting. I have known</l>
						<l>A man so versatile, he tried all arts,</l>
						<l>But when in each by turns he had achieved </l>
						<l>Just so much mastery as made men say,</l>
						<l>"He could be king here if he would," he threw </l>
						<l>The lauded skill aside. He hates, said one, </l>
						<l>The level of achieved pre-eminence,</l>
						<l>He must be conquering still; but others said—</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>The truth, I hope: he had a meagre soul, </l>
						<l>Holding no depth where love could root itself.</l>
						<l>"Could if he would?" True greatness ever wills—</l>
						<l>It lives in wholeness if it live at all,</l>
						<l>And all its strength is knit with constancy.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>He used to say himself he was too sane </l>
						<l>To give his life away for excellence </l>
						<l>Which yet must stand, an ivory statuette</l>
						<l>Wrought to perfection through long lonely years, </l>
						<l>Huddled in the mart of mediocrities.</l>
						<l>He said, the very finest doing wins</l>
						<l>The admiring only; but to leave undone, </l>
						<l>Promise and not fulfil, like buried youth,</l>
						<l>Wins all the envious, makes them sigh your name </l>
						<l>As that fair Absent, blameless Possible,</l>
						<l>Which could alone impassion them; and thus, </l>
						<l>Serene negation has free gift of all,</l>
						<l>Panting achievement struggles, is denied,</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Or wins to lose again. What say you, Armgart? </l>
						<l>Truth has rough flavours if we bite it through;</l>
						<l>I think this sarcasm came from out its core </l>
						<l>Of bitter irony.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>It is the truth</l>
						<l>Mean souls select to feed upon. What then? </l>
						<l>Their meanness is a truth, which I will spurn. </l>
						<l>The praise I seek lives not in envious breath </l>
						<l>Using my name to blight another's deed.</l>
						<l>I sing for love of song and that renown</l>
						<l>Which is the spreading act, the world-wide share, </l>
						<l>Of good that I was born with. Had I failed— </l>
						<l>Well, that had been a truth most pitiable</l>
						<l>I cannot bear to think what life would be</l>
						<l>With high hope shrunk to endurance, stunted aims </l>
						<l>Like broken lances ground to eating-knives,</l>
						<l>A self sunk down to look with level eyes</l>
						<l>At low achievement, doomed from day to day </l>

							<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>

						<l>Have won, not lost, in your decisive throw. </l>
						<l>And I too glory in this issue; yet,</l>
						<l>The public verdict has no potency</l>
						<l>To sway my judgment of what Armgart is: </l>
						<l>My pure delight in her would be but sullied, </l>
						<l>If it o'erflowed with mixture of men's praise.</l>
						<l>And had she failed, I should have said, “The pearl</l>
						<l>Remains a pearl for me, reflects the light</l>

						<l>I confess</l>
						<l>Life is not rounded in an epigram,</l>

						<l>I quoted, merely to shape forth my thought</l>
						<l>That high success has terrors when achieved­— </l>
						<l>Like preternatural spouses whose dire love </l>
						<l>Hangs perilous on slight observances:</l>
						<l>Whence it were possible that Armgart crowned </l>
						<l>Might turn and listen to a pleading voice, </l>
						<l>Though Armgart striving in the race was deaf. </l>
						<l>You said you dared not think what life had been</l>
						<l>Without the stamp of eminence; have you thought </l>
						<l>How you will bear the poise of eminence</l>
						<l>With dread of sliding? Paint the future out </l>
						<l>As an unchecked and glorious career,</l>
						<l>'Twill grow more strenuous by the very love </l>
						<l>You bear to excellence, the very fate</l>

						<l>Rather than crawl in safety. And, besides, </l>
						<l>I am an artist as you are a noble:</l>

						<l>
							<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Such parallels, dear Armgart, are but snares </l>
						<l>To catch the mind with seeming argument—</l>
						<l>Small baits of likeness 'mid disparity.</l>
						<l>Men rise the higher as their task is high,</l>
						<l>The task being well achieved. A woman's rank </l>
						<l>Lies in the fulness of her womanhood:</l>
						<l>Therein alone she is royal.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Yes, I know</l>
						<l>The oft-taught Gospel: “Woman, thy desire </l>
						<l>Shall be that all superlatives on earth </l>
						<l>Belong to men, save the one highest kind—</l>
						<l>To be a mother. Thou shalt not desire</l>
						<l>To do aught best save pure subservience: </l>
						<l>Nature has willed it so!” O blessed Nature! </l>
						<l>Let her be arbitress; she gave me voice	</l>
						<l>Such as she only gives a woman child, </l>
						<l>Best of its kind, gave me ambition too,</l>
						<l>That sense transcendent which can taste the joy</l>
						<l>Of swaying multitudes, of being adored </l>
						<l>For such achievement, needed excellence,</l>
						<l>As man's best art must wait for, or be dumb. </l>
						<l>Men did not say, when I had sung last night, </l>
						<l>“’Twas good, nay, wonderful, considering </l>
						<l>She is a woman”—and then turn to add,</l>
						<l>“Tenor or baritone had sung her songs </l>
						<l>Better, of course: she's but a woman spoiled.”</l>

						<l>No!</l>
						<l>How should I say it, Armgart? I who own</l>
						<l>The magic of your nature-given art</l>
						<l>As sweetest effluence of your womanhood</l>
						<l>Which, being to my choice the best, must find </l>
						<l>The best of utterance. But this I say:</l>
						<l>Your fervid youth beguiles you; you mistake</l>
						<l>A strain of lyric passion for a life</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Which in the spending is a chronicle</l>
						<l>With ugly pages. Trust me, Armgart, trust me; </l>
						<l>Ambition exquisite as yours which soars</l>
						<l>Toward something quintessential you call fame,</l>
						<l>Is not robust enough for this gross world</l>
						<l>Whose fame is dense with false and foolish breath. </l>
						<l>Ardour, a-twin with nice refining thought, </l>
						<l>Prepares a double pain. Pain had been saved, </l>
						<l>Nay, purer glory reached, had you been throned </l>
						<l>As woman only, holding all your art ·</l>
						<l>As attribute to that dear sovereignty—</l>
						<l>Concentering your power in home delights</l>
						<l>Which penetrate and purify the world.</l>

						<l>Beyond intention. True, I came to ask </l>
						<l>A great renunciation, but not this</l>
						<l>Towards which my words at first perversely strayed,</l>

						<l>Nor will it, Armgart. I come not to seek </l>
						<l>Any renunciation save the wife's,</l>
						<l>Which turns away from other possible love</l>
						<l>Future and worthier, to take his love</l>
						<l>Who asks the name of husband. He who sought </l>
						<l>Armgart obscure, and heard her answer, "Wait"—</l>
						<l>May come without suspicion now to seek</l>

						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Yes, without suspicion </l>
						<l>Of aught save what consists with faithfulness </l>
						<l>In all expressed intent. Forgive me, Graf—</l>
						<l>I am ungrateful to no soul that loves me—</l>
						<l>To you most grateful. Yet the best intent </l>
						<l>Grasps but a living present which may grow </l>
						<l>Like any unfledged bird. You are a noble, </l>
						<l>And have a high career; just now you said </l>
						<l>'Twas higher far than aught a woman seeks </l>
						<l>Beyond mere womanhood. You claim to be </l>
						<l>More than a husband, but could not rejoice</l>
						<l>That I were more than wife. What follows, then?</l>
						<l>You choosing me with such persistency</l>
						<l>As is but stretched-out rashness, soon must find </l>
						<l>Our marriage asks concessions, asks resolve</l>
						<l>To share renunciation or demand it. </l>
						<l>Either we both renounce a mutual ease, </l>
						<l>As in a nation's need both man and wife </l>
						<l>Do public services, or one of us</l>
						<l>Must yield that something else for which each lives</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Besides the other. Men are reasoners: </l>
						<l>That premiss of superior claims perforce </l>
						<l>Urges conclusion—“Armgart, it is you.”</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>But if I say I have considered this</l>
						<l>With strict prevision, counted all the cost </l>
						<l>Which that great good of loving you demands­— </l>
						<l>Questioned my stores of patience, half resolved </l>
						<l>To live resigned without a bliss whose threat </l>
						<l>Touched you as well as me—and finally,</l>
						<l>With impetus of undivided will</l>
						<l>Returned to say, "You shall be free as now; </l>
						<l>Only accept the refuge, shelter, guard,</l>
						<l>My love will give your freedom”—then your words </l>

						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Whom I refuse to love!</l>
						<l>No; I will live alone and pour my pain </l>
						<l>With passion into music, where it turns </l>
						<l>To what is best within my better self.</l>
						<l>I will not take for husband one who deems </l>
						<l>The thing my soul acknowledges as good— </l>
						<l>The thing I hold worth striving, suffering for,</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>To be a thing dispensed with easily, </l>
						<l>Or else the idol of a mind infirm.</l>

						<l>
							<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>Armgart, you are ungenerous; you strain</l>
						<l>My thought beyond its mark. Our difference </l>
						<l>Lies not so deep as love—as union</l>
						<l>Through a mysterious fitness that transcends </l>
						<l>Formal agreement.</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>
							<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>It lies deep enough </l>
						<l>To chafe the union. If many a man </l>
						<l>Refrains, degraded, from the utmost right,</l>
						<l>Because the pleadings of his wife's small fears </l>
						<l>Are little serpents biting at his heel,—</l>
						<l>How shall a woman keep her steadfastness </l>
						<l>Beneath a frost within her husband's eyes</l>
						<l>Where coldness scorches? Graf, it is your sorrow </l>
						<l>That you love Armgart. Nay, it is her sorrow </l>
						<l>That she may not love you.</l>

						</l>
					</lg>
					<lg>
						<l>She has the will— </l>
						<l>I have—who am one woman—not to take </l>

								<l>The same Salon, morning. ARMGART seated, in her bonnet and walking dress. The GRAF standing near her against the piano.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Armgart, to many minds the first success</l>
								<l>Is reason for desisting. I have known</l>
								<l>A man so versatile, he tried all arts,</l>
								<l>But when in each by turns he had achieved </l>
								<l>Just so much mastery as made men say,</l>
								<l>"He could be king here if he would," he threw </l>
								<l>The lauded skill aside. He hates, said one, </l>
								<l>The level of achieved pre-eminence,</l>
								<l>He must be conquering still; but others said—</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>The truth, I hope: he had a meagre soul, </l>
								<l>Holding no depth where love could root itself.</l>
								<l>"Could if he would?" True greatness ever wills—</l>
								<l>It lives in wholeness if it live at all,</l>
								<l>And all its strength is knit with constancy.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>He used to say himself he was too sane </l>
								<l>To give his life away for excellence </l>
								<l>Which yet must stand, an ivory statuette</l>
								<l>Wrought to perfection through long lonely years, </l>
								<l>Huddled in the mart of mediocrities.</l>
								<l>He said, the very finest doing wins</l>
								<l>The admiring only; but to leave undone, </l>
								<l>Promise and not fulfil, like buried youth,</l>
								<l>Wins all the envious, makes them sigh your name </l>
								<l>As that fair Absent, blameless Possible,</l>
								<l>Which could alone impassion them; and thus, </l>
								<l>Serene negation has free gift of all,</l>
								<l>Panting achievement struggles, is denied,</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Or wins to lose again. What say you, Armgart? </l>
								<l>Truth has rough flavours if we bite it through;</l>
								<l>I think this sarcasm came from out its core </l>
								<l>Of bitter irony.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>It is the truth</l>
								<l>Mean souls select to feed upon. What then? </l>
								<l>Their meanness is a truth, which I will spurn. </l>
								<l>The praise I seek lives not in envious breath </l>
								<l>Using my name to blight another's deed.</l>
								<l>I sing for love of song and that renown</l>
								<l>Which is the spreading act, the world-wide share, </l>
								<l>Of good that I was born with. Had I failed— </l>
								<l>Well, that had been a truth most pitiable</l>
								<l>I cannot bear to think what life would be</l>
								<l>With high hope shrunk to endurance, stunted aims </l>
								<l>Like broken lances ground to eating-knives,</l>
								<l>A self sunk down to look with level eyes</l>
								<l>At low achievement, doomed from day to day </l>
								<l>To distaste of its consciousness. But I—</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Have won, not lost, in your decisive throw. </l>
								<l>And I too glory in this issue; yet,</l>
								<l>The public verdict has no potency</l>
								<l>To sway my judgment of what Armgart is: </l>
								<l>My pure delight in her would be but sullied, </l>
								<l>If it o'erflowed with mixture of men's praise.</l>
								<l>And had she failed, I should have said, “The pearl</l>
								<l>Remains a pearl for me, reflects the light</l>
								<l>With the same fitness that first charmed my gaze—</l>
								<l>Is worth as fine a setting now as then."</l>

								<l>Oh, you are good! But why will you rehearse </l>
								<l>The talk of cynics, who with insect eyes </l>
								<l>Explore the secrets of the rubbish-heap?</l>
								<l>I hate your epigrams and pointed saws </l>
								<l>Whose narrow truth is but broad falsity. </l>
								<l>Confess your friend was shallow.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I confess</l>
								<l>Life is not rounded in an epigram,</l>
								<l>And saying aught, we leave a world unsaid. </l>
								<l>I quoted, merely to shape forth my thought</l>
								<l>That high success has terrors when achieved­— </l>
								<l>Like preternatural spouses whose dire love </l>
								<l>Hangs perilous on slight observances:</l>
								<l>Whence it were possible that Armgart crowned </l>
								<l>Might turn and listen to a pleading voice, </l>
								<l>Though Armgart striving in the race was deaf. </l>
								<l>You said you dared not think what life had been</l>
								<l>Without the stamp of eminence; have you thought </l>
								<l>How you will bear the poise of eminence</l>
								<l>With dread of sliding? Paint the future out </l>
								<l>As an unchecked and glorious career,</l>
								<l>'Twill grow more strenuous by the very love </l>
								<l>You bear to excellence, the very fate</l>
								<l>Of human powers, which tread at every step </l>
								<l>On possible verges.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I accept the peril.</l>
								<l>I choose to walk high with sublimer dread</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Rather than crawl in safety. And, besides, </l>
								<l>I am an artist as you are a noble:</l>
								<l>I ought to bear the burthen of my rank.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Such parallels, dear Armgart, are but snares </l>
								<l>To catch the mind with seeming argument—</l>
								<l>Small baits of likeness 'mid disparity.</l>
								<l>Men rise the higher as their task is high,</l>
								<l>The task being well achieved. A woman's rank </l>
								<l>Lies in the fulness of her womanhood:</l>
								<l>Therein alone she is royal.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Yes, I know</l>
								<l>The oft-taught Gospel: “Woman, thy desire </l>
								<l>Shall be that all superlatives on earth </l>
								<l>Belong to men, save the one highest kind—</l>
								<l>To be a mother. Thou shalt not desire</l>
								<l>To do aught best save pure subservience: </l>
								<l>Nature has willed it so!” O blessed Nature! </l>
								<l>Let her be arbitress; she gave me voice	</l>
								<l>Such as she only gives a woman child, </l>
								<l>Best of its kind, gave me ambition too,</l>
								<l>That sense transcendent which can taste the joy</l>
								<l>Of swaying multitudes, of being adored </l>
								<l>For such achievement, needed excellence,</l>
								<l>As man's best art must wait for, or be dumb. </l>
								<l>Men did not say, when I had sung last night, </l>
								<l>“’Twas good, nay, wonderful, considering </l>
								<l>She is a woman”—and then turn to add,</l>
								<l>“Tenor or baritone had sung her songs </l>
								<l>Better, of course: she's but a woman spoiled.”</l>
								<l>I beg your pardon, Graf, you said it.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>No!</l>
								<l>How should I say it, Armgart? I who own</l>
								<l>The magic of your nature-given art</l>
								<l>As sweetest effluence of your womanhood</l>
								<l>Which, being to my choice the best, must find </l>
								<l>The best of utterance. But this I say:</l>
								<l>Your fervid youth beguiles you; you mistake</l>
								<l>A strain of lyric passion for a life</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Which in the spending is a chronicle</l>
								<l>With ugly pages. Trust me, Armgart, trust me; </l>
								<l>Ambition exquisite as yours which soars</l>
								<l>Toward something quintessential you call fame,</l>
								<l>Is not robust enough for this gross world</l>
								<l>Whose fame is dense with false and foolish breath. </l>
								<l>Ardour, a-twin with nice refining thought, </l>
								<l>Prepares a double pain. Pain had been saved, </l>
								<l>Nay, purer glory reached, had you been throned </l>
								<l>As woman only, holding all your art ·</l>
								<l>As attribute to that dear sovereignty—</l>
								<l>Concentering your power in home delights</l>
								<l>Which penetrate and purify the world.</l>

							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>What! leave the opera with my part ill-sung </l>
								<l>While I was warbling in a drawing-room?</l>
								<l>Sing in the chimney-corner to inspire</l>
								<l>My husband reading news? Let the world hear </l>
								<l>My music only in his morning speech</l>
								<l>Less stammering than most honourable men's?</l>
								<l>No! tell me that my song is poor, my art</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>The piteous feat of weakness aping strength—</l>
								<l>That were fit proem to your argument.</l>
								<l>Till then, I am an artist by my birth—</l>
								<l>By the same warrant that I am a woman: </l>
								<l>Nay, in the added rarer gift I see </l>
								<l>Supreme vocation: if a conflict comes, </l>
								<l>Perish—no, not the woman, but the joys</l>
								<l>Which men make narrow by their narrowness. </l>
								<l>Oh, I am happy! The great masters write</l>
								<l>For women's voices, and great Music wants me!</l>
								<l>I need not crush myself within a mould </l>
								<l>Of theory called Nature: I have room </l>
								<l>To breathe and grow unstunted.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Armgart, hear me.</l>
								<l>I meant not that our talk should hurry on</l>
								<l>To such collision. Foresight of the ills</l>
								<l>Thick shadowing your path, drew on my speech</l>
								<l>Beyond intention. True, I came to ask </l>
								<l>A great renunciation, but not this</l>
								<l>Towards which my words at first perversely strayed,</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>As if in memory of their earlier suit, </l>
								<l>Forgetful . . . . . . . . . . </l>
								<l>Armgart, do you remember too? the suit</l>
								<l>Had but postponement, was not quite disdained­— </l>
								<l>Was told to wait and learn—what it has learned—</l>
								<l>A more submissive speech.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART</speaker>
									<stage>(with some agitation).</stage>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Then it forgot </l>
								<l>Its lesson cruelly. As I remember,</l>
								<l>'Twas not to speak save to the artist crowned,</l>
								<l>Nor speak to her of casting off her crown.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>

								<l>Nor will it, Armgart. I come not to seek </l>

								<l>Which turns away from other possible love</l>
								<l>Future and worthier, to take his love</l>
								<l>Who asks the name of husband. He who sought </l>
								<l>Armgart obscure, and heard her answer, "Wait"—</l>

								<l>In all expressed intent. Forgive me, Graf—</l>
								<l>I am ungrateful to no soul that loves me—</l>
								<l>To you most grateful. Yet the best intent </l>
								<l>Grasps but a living present which may grow </l>

							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>To be a thing dispensed with easily, </l>
								<l>Or else the idol of a mind infirm.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Armgart, you are ungenerous; you strain</l>
								<l>My thought beyond its mark. Our difference </l>
								<l>Lies not so deep as love—as union</l>
								<l>Through a mysterious fitness that transcends </l>
								<l>Formal agreement.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>It lies deep enough </l>
								<l>To chafe the union. If many a man </l>
								<l>Refrains, degraded, from the utmost right,</l>
								<l>Because the pleadings of his wife's small fears </l>
								<l>Are little serpents biting at his heel,—</l>
								<l>How shall a woman keep her steadfastness </l>
								<l>Beneath a frost within her husband's eyes</l>
								<l>Where coldness scorches? Graf, it is your sorrow </l>
								<l>That you love Armgart. Nay, it is her sorrow </l>
								<l>That she may not love you.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Woman, it seems, </l>
								<l>Has enviable power to love or not </l>
								<l>According to her will.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>She has the will— </l>
								<l>I have—who am one woman—not to take </l>
								<l>Disloyal pledges that divide her will.</l>
								<l>The man who marries me must wed my Art— </l>
								<l>Honour and cherish it, not tolerate.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>The man is yet to come whose theory</l>
								<l>Will weigh as nought with you against his love.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>

								<l>Himself a singer, then? who knows no life</l>

								<l>Out of the opera books, where tenor parts </l>
								<l>Are found to suit him?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>You are bitter, Graf.</l>
								<l>Forgive me; seek the woman you deserve, </l>
								<l>All grace, all goodness, who has not yet found </l>
								<l>A meaning in her life, nor any end</l>
								<l>Beyond fulfilling yours. The type abounds.</l>

								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Yes, happily.</l>
								<l>Let it excuse me that my kind is rare: </l>
								<l>Commonness is its own security.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>GRAF.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Armgart, I would with all my soul I knew </l>
								<l>The man so rare that he could make your life </l>
								<l>As woman sweet to you, as artist safe.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Oh, I can live unmated, but not live </l>
								<l>Without the bliss of singing to the world, </l>
								<l>And feeling all my world respond to me.</l>

								<l>

								<l>SCENE III.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>A YEAR LATER.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>The same Salon. WALPURGA is standing looking towards the window with an air of uneasiness. DOCTOR GRAHN.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Where is my patient, Fräulein?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Fled! escaped!</l>
								<l>Gone to rehearsal. Is it dangerous?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>No, no; her throat is cured. I only came</l>
								<l>To hear her try her voice. Had she yet sung?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>No; she had meant to wait for you. She said, </l>
								<l>"The Doctor has a right to my first song." </l>
								<l>Her gratitude was full of little plans,</l>
								<l>But all were swept away like gathered flowers</l>
								<l>By sudden storm. She saw this opera bill—</l>
								<l>It was a wasp to sting her: she turned pale, </l>
								<l>Snatched up her hat and mufflers, said in haste, </l>
								<l>“I go to Leo—to rehearsal—none</l>
								<l>Shall sing Fidelio to-night but me!”</l>
								<l>Then rushed down-stairs.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
									<stage>(looking at his watch).</stage>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>And this, not long ago?</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Barely an hour.</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I will come again,</l>
								<l>Returning from Charlottenburg at one.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Doctor, I feel a strange presentiment. </l>
								<l>Are you quite easy?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>She can take no harm. </l>
								<l>'Twas time for her to sing: her throat is well. </l>
								<l>It was a fierce attack, and dangerous;</l>
								<l>I had to use strong remedies, but—well! </l>
								<l>At one, dear Fräulein, we shall meet again,</l>

							<lg>
								<l>Two Hours Later</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>WALPURGA starts up, looking towards the door. ARMGART enters, followed by LEO. She throws herself on a chair which stands with its back towards the door, speechless, not seeming to see anything. WALPURGA casts a questioning terrified look at LEO. He shrugs his shoulders, and lifts up his hands behind ARMGART, who sits like a helpless image, while WALPURGA takes off her hat and mantle.</l>

								<l>Armgart, dear Armgart

							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Your poor Walpurga. Oh, your hands are cold.</l>
								<l>Clasp mine, and warm them! I will kiss them warm.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<stage>(ARMGART looks at her an instant, then draws away her hands, and, turning aside, buries her face against the back of the chair, WALPURGA rising and standing near.)</stage>

								<l>News! stirring news to-day! wonders come thick.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART</speaker>
									<stage>(starting up at the first sound of his voice, and speaking vehemently).</stage>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Yes, thick, thick, thick! and you have murdered it! </l>
								<l>Murdered my voice—poisoned the soul in me,</l>
								<l>And kept me living.</l>
								<l>You never told me that your cruel cures</l>
								<l>Were clogging films—a mouldy, dead'ning blight—</l>
								<l>A lava-mud to crust and bury me,</l>
								<l>Yet hold me living in a deep, deep tomb,</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Crying unheard for ever! Oh, your cures</l>
								<l>Are devil's triumphs: you can rob, maim, slay, </l>
								<l>And keep a hell on the other side your cure </l>
								<l>Where you can see your victim quivering </l>
								<l>Between the teeth of torture—see a soul</l>
								<l>Made keen by loss—all anguish with a good</l>
								<l>Once known and gone! 
									<stage>(Turns and sinks back on her chair.)</stage>
								</l>
								<l>O misery, misery!</l>
								<l>You might have killed me, might have let me sleep </l>
								<l>After my happy day and wake—not here!</l>
								<l>In some new unremembered world,—not here,</l>
								<l>Where all is faded, flat—a feast broke off— </l>
								<l>Banners all meaningless—exulting words </l>
								<l>Dull, dull—a drum that lingers in the air </l>
								<l>Beating to melody which no man hears.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>DOCTOR</speaker>
									<stage>(after a moment's silence).</stage>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>A sudden check has shaken you, poor child! </l>
								<l>All things seem livid, tottering to your sense, </l>
								<l>From inward tumult. Stricken by a threat </l>
								<l>You see your terrors only. Tell me, Leo:</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>'Tis not such utter loss.</l>
								<l>
									<stage>(LEO, with a shrug, goes quietly out.)</stage>
								</l>
								<l>The freshest bloom </l>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Is ruined, withered, is a thing to hide</l>
								<l>Away from scorn or pity. Oh, you stand</l>
								<l>And look compassionate now, but when Death came </l>
								<l>With mercy in his hands, you hindered him.</l>
								<l>I did not choose to live and have your pity. </l>
								<l>You never told me, never gave me choice </l>
								<l>To die a singer, lightning-struck, unmaimed,</l>
								<l>Or live what you would make me with your cures—</l>
								<l>A self accursed with consciousness of change,</l>
								<l>A mind that lives in nought but members lopped, </l>
								<l>A power turned to pain—as meaningless</l>
								<l>As letters fallen asunder that once made</l>
								<l>A hymn of rapture. Oh, I had meaning once, </l>
								<l>Like day and sweetest air. What am I now? </l>
								<l>The millionth woman in superfluous herds. </l>
								<l>Why should I be, do, think? 'Tis thistle-seed,</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>The Doctor gave it you?</l>
								<l>It is an anodyne. Put it away.</l>
								<l>He cured me of my voice, and now he wants </l>
								<l>To cure me of my vision and resolve—</l>
								<l>Drug me to sleep that I may wake again </l>
								<l>Without a purpose, abject as the rest</l>
								<l>To bear the yoke of life. He shall not cheat me</l>
								<l>Of that fresh strength which anguish gives the soul, </l>
								<l>The inspiration of revolt, ere rage</l>
								<l>Slackens to faltering. Now I see the truth.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA</speaker>

								<l>I say then, you are simply fevered, mad; </l>

								<l>If you would change the light, throw into shade </l>
								<l>The loss you aggrandise, and let day fall</l>
								<l>On good remaining, nay on good refused</l>
								<l>Which may be gain now. Did you not reject </l>
								<l>A woman's lot more brilliant, as some held, </l>
								<l>Than any singer's? It may still be yours.</l>
								<l>Graf Dornberg loved you well.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Not me, not me.</l>
								<l>He loved one well who was like me in all </l>
								<l>Save in a voice which made that All unlike </l>
								<l>As diamond is to charcoal. Oh, a man's love!</l>
								<l>Think you he loves a woman's inner self </l>
								<l>Aching with loss of loveliness?—as mothers </l>

								<l>But the Graf</l>
								<l>Chose you as simple Armgart—had preferred </l>
								<l>That you should never seek for any fame</l>
								<l>But such as matrons have who rear great sons. </l>
								<l>And therefore you rejected him; but now—</l>
							</lg>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>

								<l>An ordinary girl—a plain brown girl,</l>

								<l>Shocks as a disproportioned thing—a Will </l>
								<l>That, like an arm astretch and broken off,</l>
								<l>Has nought to hurl—the torso of a soul. </l>
								<l>I sang him into love of me: my song </l>
								<l>Was consecration, lifted me apart</l>
								<l>From the crowd chiselled like me, sister forms, </l>
								<l>But empty of divineness. Nay, my charm </l>
								<l>Was half that I could win fame yet renounce! </l>
								<l>A wife with glory possible absorbed</l>

							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>For shame!</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>No, and thrice no!</l>
								<l>It would be pitying constancy, not love, </l>
								<l>That brought him to me now. I will not be </l>
								<l>A pensioner in marriage. Sacraments</l>
								<l>Are not to feed the paupers of the world. </l>
								<l>If he were generous—I am generous too.</l>

								</l>

							<lg>
								<l>“I am deeply moved—my heart is rent, to hear of </l>
								<l>your illness and its cruel result, just now communi­</l>
								<l>cated to me by Dr Grahn. But surely it is possible </l>
								<l>that this result may not be permanent. For youth </l>
								<l>such as yours, Time may hold in store something </l>
								<l>more than resignation: who shall say that it does </l>
								<l>not hold renewal? I have not dared to ask admis-</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>sion to you in the hours of a recent shock, but I </l>
								<l>cannot depart on a long mission without tendering </l>
								<l>my sympathy and my farewell. I start this evening </l>
								<l>for the Caucasus, and thence I proceed to India, </l>
								<l>where I am intrusted by the Government with busi­</l>

								<l>The Graf has much discretion. I am glad. </l>

								<l>With high superfluousness; her thoughts a crop</l>

								<l>Of chick-weed errors or of pot-herb facts, </l>
								<l>Smiled at like some child's drawing on a slate.</l>
								<l>“Genteel?"	"O yes, gives lessons; not so good </l>

								<l>“Pretty?" "No; yet she makes a figure fit </l>
								<l>For good society. Poor thing, she sews </l>

								<l>Might do well, marrying her; but in these days! . . .</l>
								<l>Well, she can somewhat eke her narrow gains </l>

								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Because Heaven made me royal—wrought me out</l>
								<l>With subtle finish towards pre-eminence, </l>
								<l>Made every channel of my soul converge</l>
								<l>To one high function, and then flung me down, </l>
								<l>That breaking I might turn to subtlest pain.</l>
								<l>An inborn passion gives a rebel's right: </l>
								<l>I would rebel and die in twenty worlds</l>
								<l>Sooner than bear the yoke of thwarted life,</l>
								<l>Each keenest sense turned into keen distaste,</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Hunger not satisfied but kept alive </l>
								<l>Breathing in languor half a century.</l>
								<l>All the world now is but a rack of threads </l>
								<l>To twist and dwarf me into pettiness</l>
								<l>And basely feigned content, the placid mask </l>
								<l>Of women's misery.</l>
							</lg>

								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA</speaker>

								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Ay, such a mask </l>
								<l>As the few born like you to easy joy, </l>
								<l>Cradled in privilege, take for natural </l>
								<l>On all the lowly faces that must look </l>
								<l>Upward to you! What revelation now</l>
								<l>Shows you the mask or gives presentiment </l>
								<l>Of sadness hidden? You who every day </l>
								<l>These five years saw me limp to wait on you,</l>
								<l>And thought the order perfect which gave me,</l>
								<l>The girl without pretension to be aught, </l>
								<l>A splendid cousin for my happiness:</l>
								<l>To watch the night through when her brain was fired</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>With too much gladness—listen, always listen </l>
								<l>To what she felt, who having power had right </l>
								<l>To feel exorbitantly, and submerge</l>
								<l>The souls around her with the poured-out flood</l>
								<l>Of what must be ere she were satisfied!</l>
								<l>That was feigned patience, was it? Why not love, </l>
								<l>Love nurtured even with that strength of self </l>
								<l>Which found no room save in another's life?</l>
								<l>Oh, such as I know joy by negatives, </l>
								<l>And all their deepest passion is a pang </l>
								<l>Till they accept their pauper's heritage,</l>
								<l>And meekly live from out the general store</l>
								<l>Of joy they were born stripped of. I accept—</l>
								<l>Nay, now would sooner choose it than the wealth </l>
								<l>Of natures you call royal, who can live</l>
								<l>In mere mock knowledge of their fellows' woe, </l>
								<l>Thinking their smiles may heal it.</l>

									<speaker>ARMGART</speaker>

								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Nay, Walpurga,</l>
								<l>I did not make a palace of my joy</l>
								<l>To shut the world's truth from me. All my good</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Was that I touched the world and made a part</l>
								<l>In the world's dower of beauty, strength, and bliss;</l>
								<l>It was the glimpse of consciousness divine </l>
								<l>Which pours out day and sees the day is good. </l>
								<l>Now I am fallen dark; I sit in gloom,</l>
								<l>Remembering bitterly. Yet you speak truth; </l>
								<l>I wearied you, it seems; took all your help </l>
								<l>As cushioned nobles use a weary serf,</l>
								<l>Not looking at his face.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Oh, I but stand </l>
								<l>As a small symbol for the mighty sum</l>
								<l>Of claims unpaid to needy myriads;</l>
								<l>I think you never set your loss beside </l>
								<l>That mighty deficit. Is your work gone— </l>
								<l>The prouder queenly work that paid itself</l>
								<l>And yet was overpaid with men's applause? </l>
								<l>Are you no longer chartered, privileged,</l>
								<l>But sunk to simple woman's penury, </l>
								<l>To ruthless Nature's chary average—</l>
								<l>Where is the rebel's right for you alone?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Noble rebellion lifts a common load;</l>
								<l>But what is he who flings his own load off</l>
								<l>And leaves his fellows toiling? Rebel's right? </l>
								<l>Say rather, the deserter's. Oh, you smiled </l>
								<l>From your clear height on all the million lots </l>
								<l>Which yet you brand as abject.</l>

							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I was blind</l>
								<l>With too much happiness: true vision comes </l>
								<l>Only, it seems, with sorrow. Were there one </l>
								<l>This moment near me, suffering what I feel, </l>
								<l>And needing me for comfort in her pang—</l>
								<l>Then it were worth the while to live; not else.</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>One—near you—why, they throng! you hardly stir </l>
								<l>But your act touches them. We touch afar.</l>
								<l>For did not swarthy slaves of yesterday</l>
								<l>Leap in their bondage at the Hebrews' flight,</l>
								<l>Which touched them through the thrice millennial dark?</l>
							</lg>

							<lg>
								<l>Is it not you, Walpurga, who are hard? </l>

								<l>
									<speaker>WALPURGA.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>You would not hear </l>
								<l>The "chant of consolation:" words of hope</l>
								<l>Only embittered you. Then hear the truth— </l>
								<l>A lame girl's truth, whom no one ever praised </l>
								<l>For being cheerful. ''It is well," they said:</l>
								<l>"Were she cross-grained she could not be endured."</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>A word of truth from her had startled you;</l>
								<l>But you—you claimed the universe; nought less </l>
								<l>Than all existence working in sure tracks</l>
								<l>Towards your supremacy. The wheels might scathe</l>
								<l>A myriad destinies—nay, must perforce;</l>
								<l>But yours they must keep clear of; just for you </l>
								<l>The seething atoms through the firmament </l>
								<l>Must bear a human heart—which you had not! </l>
								<l>For what is it to you that women, men,</l>
								<l>Plod, faint, are weary, and espouse despair</l>
								<l>Of aught but fellowship? Save that you spurn </l>
								<l>To be among them? Now, then, you are lame—</l>
								<l>Maimed, as you said, and levelled with the crowd: </l>
								<l>Call it new birth—birth from that monstrous Self </l>
								<l>Which, smiling down upon a race oppressed,</l>
								<l>Says, "All is good, for I am throned at ease."</l>

								<l>Do you think yours will live when you are dead?</l>

								<l>
									<speaker>Leo.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Pfui! The time was, I drank that home-brewed wine</l>
								<l>And found it heady, while my blood was young:</l>
								<l>Now it scarce warms me. Tipple it as I may,</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I am sober still, and say: "My old friend Leo, </l>
								<l>Much grain is wasted in the world and rots; </l>
								<l>Why not thy handful?"</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Strange! since I have known you </l>
								<l>Till now I never wondered how you lived.</l>
								<l>When I sang well—that was your jubilee. </l>
								<l>But you were old already.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>Leo.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Yes, child, yes:</l>
								<l>Youth thinks itself the goal of each old life; </l>
								<l>Age has but travelled from a far-off time</l>
								<l>Just to be ready for youth's service. Well! </l>
								<l>It was my chief delight to perfect you.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Good Leo! You have lived on little joys. </l>
								<l>But your delight in me is crushed for ever.</l>
								<l>Your pains, where are they now? They shaped intent</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Which action frustrates; shaped an inward sense </l>
								<l>Which is but keen despair, the agony</l>
								<l>Of highest vision in the lowest pit.</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>Leo.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Nay, nay, I have a thought: keep to the stage, </l>
								<l>To drama without song; for you can act—</l>
								<l>Who knows how well, when all the soul is poured </l>
								<l>Into that sluice alone?</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>
									<speaker>ARMGART.</speaker>
								</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>I know, and you: </l>
								<l>The second or third best in tragedies</l>
								<l>That cease to touch the fibre of the time. </l>
								<l>No; song is gone, but nature's other gift,</l>
								<l>Self-judgment, is not gone. Song was my speech, </l>
								<l>And with its impulse only, action came:</l>
								<l>Song was the battle's onset, when cool purpose </l>
								<l>Glows into rage, becomes a warring god</l>
								<l>And moves the limbs with miracle. But now—</l>
								<l>Oh, I should stand hemmed in with thoughts and rules—</l>
							</lg>
							<lg>
								<l>Say "This way passion acts," yet never feel </l>
								<l>The might of passion. How should I declaim? </l>
								<l>As monsters write with feet instead of hands.</l>
								<l>I will not feed on doing great tasks ill, </l>
								<l>Dull the world's sense with mediocrity, </l>
								<l>And live by trash that smothers excellence.</l>
								<l>One gift I had that ranked me with the best— </l>
								<l>The secret of my frame—and that is gone.</l>
								<l>For all life now I am a broken thing.</l>
								<l>But silence there! Good Leo, advise me now. </l>
								<l>I would take humble work and do it well—</l>
								<l>Teach music, singing—what I can—not here, </l>
								<l>But in some smaller town where I may bring </l>
								<l>The method you have taught me, pass your gift </l>
								<l>To others who can use it for delight.</l>
								<l>You think I can do that?</l>

							<l>To suit with hurling act a well-hurled curse</l>
							<l>At labor on such perishable stuff.</l>
							<l>Hence neighbors in Cremona held him dull.</l>
							<l>Called him a slave, a mill-horse, a machine.</l>
							<l>Begged him to tell his motives, or to lend</l>
							<l>A few gold-pieces to a loftier mind.</l>
							<l>Yet he had pithy words full fed by fact;</l>
							<l>For Fact, well-trusted, reasons and persuades,</l>
							<l>Is gnomic, cutting, or ironical.</l>
							<l>Draws tears, or is a tocsin to arouse—</l>
							<l>Can hold all figures of the orator</l>
							<l>In one plain sentence; has her pauses too—</l>
							<l>Eloquent silence at the chasm abrupt</l>
							<l>Where knowledge ceases. Thus Antonio</l>
							<l>Made answers as Fact willed, and made them strong.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Naldo, a painter of eclectic school,</l>
							<l>Taking his dicers, candlelight and grins</l>
							<l>From Caravaggio, and in holier groups</l>
							<l>Combining Flemish flesh with martyrdom—</l>
							<l>Knowing all tricks of style at thirty-one,</l>
							<l>And weary of them, while Antonio</l>
							<l>At sixty-nine wrought placidly his best</l>
							<l>Making the violin you heard to-day—</l>
							<l>Naldo would tease him oft to tell his aims.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Perhaps thou hast some pleasant vice to feed—</l>
							<l>The love of louis d'ors in heaps of four,</l>
							<l>Each violin a heap—I've nought to blame;</l>
							<l>My vices waste such heaps. But then, why work</l>
							<l>With painful nicety? Since fame once earned</l>
							<l>By luck or merit—oftenest by luck—</l>
							<l>(Else why do I put Bonifazio's name</l>
							<l>To work that 'pinxit Naldo' would not sell?)</l>
							<l>Is welcome index to the wealthy mob</l>
							<l>Where they should pay their gold, and where they pay</l>
							<l>There they find merit—take your tow for flax,</l>
							<l>And hold the flax unlabelled with your name,</l>
							<l>Too coarse for sufferance."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Antonio then:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"I like the gold—well, yes—but not for meals.</l>
							<l>And as my stomach, so my eye and hand,</l>
							<l>And inward sense that works along with both,</l>
							<l>Have hunger that can never feed on coin.</l>
							<l>Who draws a line and satisfies his soul,</l>
							<l>Making it crooked where it should be straight?</l>
							<l>An idiot with an oyster-shell may draw</l>
							<l>His lines along the sand, all wavering,</l>
							<l>Fixing no point or pathway to a point;</l>
							<l>An idiot one remove may choose his line,</l>
							<l>Straggle and be content; but God be praised,</l>
							<l>Antonio Stradivari has an eye</l>
							<l>That winces at false work, and loves the true,</l>
							<l>With hand and arm that play upon the tool</l>
							<l>As willingly as any singing bird</l>
							<l>Sets him to sing his morning roundelay.</l>
							<l>Because he likes to sing and likes the song."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Then Naldo: "'Tis a petty kind of fame</l>
							<l>At best, that comes of making violins;</l>
							<l>And saves no masses, either. Thou wilt go</l>
							<l>To purgatory none the less."</l>
							<l>But he:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Twere purgatory here to make them ill;</l>
							<l>And for my fame — when any master holds,</l>
							<l>'Twixt chin and hand a violin of mine,</l>
							<l>He will be glad that Stradivari lived,</l>
							<l>Made violins, and made them of the best.</l>
							<l>The masters only know whose work is good:</l>
							<l>They will choose mine, and while God gives them skill</l>
							<l>I give them instruments to play upon,</l>
							<l>God choosing me to help Him."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"What! were God</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>At fault for violins, thou absent?"</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Yes;</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>He were at fault for Stradivari's work."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Why, many hold Giuseppe's violins</l>
							<l>As good as thine."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"May be: they are different.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>His quality declines: he spoils his hand</l>
							<l>With over-drinking. But were his the best,</l>
							<l>He could not work for two. My work is mine,</l>
							<l>And, heresy or not, if my hand slacked,</l>
							<l>I should rob God—since He is fullest good—</l>
							<l>Leaving a blank instead of violins.</l>
							<l>I say, not God Himself can make man's best</l>
							<l>Without best men to help Him. I am one best</l>
							<l>Here in Cremona, using sunlight well</l>
							<l>To fashion finest maple till it serves</l>
							<l>More cunningly than throats, for harmony.</l>
							<l>'Tis rare delight: I would not change my skill</l>
							<l>To be the Emperor with bungling hands.</l>
							<l>And lose my work, which comes as natural</l>
							<l>As self at waking."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Thou art little more</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Than a deft potter's wheel, Antonio;</l>
							<l>Taming out work by mere necessity</l>
							<l>And lack of varied function. Higher arts</l>
							<l>Subsist on freedom—eccentricity—</l>
							<l>Uncounted inspirations—influence</l>
							<l>That comes with drinking, gambling, talk turned wild,</l>
							<l>Then moody misery and lack of food—</l>
							<l>With every dithyrambic fine excess:</l>
							<l>These make at last a storm which flashes out</l>
							<l>In lighting revelations. Steady work</l>
							<l>Turns genius to a loom; the soul must lie</l>
							<l>Like grapes beneath the sun till ripeness comes</l>
							<l>And mellow vintage. I could paint you now</l>
							<l>The finest Crucifixion; yesternight</l>
							<l>Returning home I saw it on a sky</l>
							<l>Blue-black, thick-starred. I want-two louis d'ors</l>
							<l>To buy the canvas and the costly blues—</l>
							<l>Trust me a fortnight."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"Where are those last two</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>I lent thee for thy Judith?—her thou saw'st</l>
							<l>In saffron gown, with Holofernes' head</l>
							<l>And beauty all complete? "</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"She is but sketched:</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>I lack the proper model—and the mood.</l>
							<l>A great idea is an eagle's egg,</l>
							<l>Craves time for hatching; while the eagle sits</l>
							<l>Feed her."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"If thou wilt call thy pictures eggs</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>I call the hatching, work. 'Tis God gives skill,</l>
							<l>But not without men's hands: He could not make</l>

							<l>Without Antonio. Get thee to thy easel."</l>

						<teiSubTitle>The Death of Moses</teiSubTitle>
						<lg>
							<l>MOSES, who spake with God as with his friend,</l>
							<l>And ruled his people with the twofold power</l>
							<l>Of wisdom that can dare and still be meek,</l>
							<l>Was writing his last word, the sacred name</l>
							<l>Unutterable of that Eternal Will</l>
							<l>Which was and is and evermore shall be.</l>
							<l>Yet was his task not finished, for the flock</l>
							<l>Needed its shepherd and the life-taught sage</l>
							<l>Leaves no successor ; but to chosen men.</l>
							<l>The rescuers and guides of Israel,</l>
							<l>A death was given called the Death of Grace,</l>
							<l>Which freed them from the burden of the flesh</l>
							<l>But left them rulers of the multitude</l>
							<l>And loved companions of the lonely. This</l>
							<l>Was God's last gift to Moses, this the hour</l>
							<l>When soul must part from self and be but soul.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>God spake to Gabriel, the messenger</l>
							<l>Of mildest death that draws the parting life</l>
							<l>Gently, as when a little rosy child</l>
							<l>Lifts up its lips from off the bowl of milk</l>
							<l>And so draws forth a curl that dipped its gold</l>
							<l>In the soft white — thus Gabriel draws the soul.</l>
							<l>"Go bring the soul of Moses unto me !"</l>
							<l>And the awe-stricken angel answered, "Lord,</l>
							<l>How shall I dare to take his life who lives</l>
							<l>Sole of his kind, not to be likened once</l>
							<l>In all the generations of the earth ? "</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Then God called Michaël, him of pensive brow,</l>
							<l>Snow-vest and flaming sword, who knows and acts:</l>
							<l>"Go bring the spirit of Moses unto me!"</l>
							<l>But Michaël with such grief as angels feel,</l>
							<l>Loving the mortals whom they succor, pled:</l>
							<l>"Almighty, spare me; it was I who taught</l>
							<l>Thy servant Moses; he is part of me</l>
							<l>As I of thy deep secrets, knowing them."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Then God called Zamaël, the terrible,</l>
							<l>The angel of fierce death, of agony</l>
							<l>That comes in battle and in pestilence</l>
							<l>Remorseless, sudden or with lingering throes.</l>
							<l>And Zamaël, his raiment and broad wings</l>
							<l>Blood-tinctured, the dark lustre of his eyes</l>
							<l>Shrouding the red, fell like the gathering night</l>
							<l>Before the prophet. But that radiance</l>
							<l>Won from the heavenly presence in the mount</l>
							<l>Gleamed on the prophet's brow and dazzling pierced</l>
							<l>Its conscious opposite: the angel turned</l>
							<l>His murky gaze aloof and inly said:</l>
							<l>"An angel this, deathless to angel's stroke."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But Moses felt the subtly nearing dark:</l>
							<l>"Who art thou? and what wilt thou?" Zamaël then:</l>
							<l>"I am God's reaper; through the fields of life</l>
							<l>I gather ripened and unripened souls</l>
							<l>Both willing and unwilling. And I come</l>
							<l>Now to reap thee." But Moses cried.</l>
							<l>Firm as a seer who waits the trusted sign:</l>
							<l>"Reap thou the fruitless plant and common herb—</l>
							<l>Not him who from the womb was sanctified</l>
							<l>To teach the law of purity and love."</l>
							<l>And Zamaël baffled from his errand fled.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But Moses, pausing, in the air serene</l>
							<l>Heard now that mystic whisper, far yet near,</l>
							<l>The all-penetrating Voice, that said to him,</l>
							<l>"Moses, the hour is come and thou must die."</l>
							<l>"Lord, I obey; but thou rememberest</l>
							<l>How thou, Ineffable, didst take me once</l>
							<l>Within thy orb of light untouched by death."</l>
							<l>Then the voice answered, "Be no more afraid:</l>
							<l>With me shall be thy death and burial."</l>
							<l>So Moses waited, ready now to die.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>And the Lord came, invisible as a thought.</l>
							<l>Three angels gleaming on his secret track.</l>
							<l>Prince Michaël, Zagaël, Gabriel, charged to guard</l>
							<l>The soul-forsaken body as it fell</l>
							<l>And bear it to the hidden sepulchre</l>
							<l>Denied forever to the search of man.</l>
							<l>And the Voice said to Moses: "Close thine eyes."</l>
							<l>He closed them. "Lay thine hand upon thine heart.</l>
							<l>And draw thy feet together." He obeyed.</l>
							<l>And the Lord said, "O spirit! child of mine!</l>
							<l>A hundred years and twenty thou hast dwelt</l>
							<l>Within this tabernacle wrought of clay.</l>
							<l>This is the end: come forth and flee to heaven."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But the grieved soul with plaintive pleading cried,</l>
							<l>"I love this body with a clinging love:</l>
							<l>The courage fails me. Lord, to part from it."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>"O child, come forth! for thou shalt dwell with me</l>
							<l>About the immortal throne where seraphs joy</l>
							<l>In growing vision and in growing love."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Yet hesitating, fluttering, like the bird</l>
							<l>With young wing weak and dubious, the soul</l>
							<l>Stayed. But behold! upon the death-dewed lips</l>
							<l>A kiss descended, pure, unspeakable—</l>
							<l>The bodiless Love without embracing Love</l>
							<l>That lingered in the body, drew it forth</l>
							<l>With heavenly strength and carried it to heaven.</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But now beneath the sky the watchers all,</l>
							<l>Angels that keep the homes of Israel</l>
							<l>Or on high purpose wander o'er the world</l>
							<l>Leading the Gentiles, felt a dark eclipse:</l>
							<l>The greatest ruler among men was gone.</l>
							<l>And from the westward sea was heard a wail,</l>
							<l>A dirge as from the isles of Javanim,</l>
							<l>Crying, "Who now is left upon the earth</l>
							<l>Like him to teach the right and smite the wrong ?"</l>
							<l>And from the East, far o'er the Syrian waste,</l>
							<l>Came slowlier, sadlier, the answering dirge:</l>
							<l>"No prophet like him lives or shall arise</l>
							<l>In Israel or the world forevermore."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>But Israel waited, looking toward the mount.</l>
							<l>Till with the deepening eve the elders came</l>
							<l>Saying, "His burial is hid with God.</l>
							<l>We stood far off and saw the angels lift</l>
							<l>His corpse aloft until they seemed a star</l>
							<l>That burnt itself away within the sky."</l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The people answered with mute orphaned gaze</l>
							<l>Looking for what had vanished evermore.</l>
							<l>Then through the gloom without them and within</l>
							<l>The spirit's shaping light, mysterious speech,</l>
							<l>Invisible Will wrought clear in sculptured sound,</l>
							<l>The thought-begotten daughter of the voice,</l>
							<l>Thrilled on their listening sense : "He has no tomb.</l>
							<l>He dwells not with you dead, but lives as Law."</l>

						<lg>
							<l>Young Hamlet, not the hesitating Dane, </l>
							<l>But one named after him, who lately strove </l>
							<l>For honours at our English Wittenberg, — </l>
							<l>Blond, metaphysical, and sensuous, </l>
							<l>Questioning all things and yet half convinced </l>
							<l>Credulity were better; held inert </l>
							<l>'Twixt fascinations of all opposites, </l>
							<l>And half suspecting that the mightiest soul </l>
							<l>(Perhaps his own?) was union of extremes, </l>
							<l>Having no choice but choice of everything: </l>
							<l>As, drinking deep to-day for love of wine, </l>
							<l>To-morrow half a Brahmin, scorning life </l>
							<l>As mere illusion, yearning for that True </l>
							<l>Which has no qualities; another day </l>
							<l>Finding the fount of grace in sacraments, </l>
							<l>And purest reflex of the light divine </l>
							<l>In gem-bossed pyx and broidered chasuble, </l>
							<l>Resolved to wear no stockings and to fast </l>
							<l>With arms extended, waiting ecstasy; </l>
							<l>But getting cramps instead, and needing change, </l>
							<l>A would-be pagan next: — </l>
							<l>Young Hamlet sat </l>
							<l>A guest with five of somewhat riper age </l>
							<l>At breakfast with Horatio, a friend </l>
							<l>With few opinions, but of faithful heart, </l>
							<l>Quick to detect the fibrous spreading roots </l>
							<l>Of character that feed men's theories, </l>
							<l>Yet cloaking weaknesses with charity </l>
							<l>And ready in all service save rebuke. </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>With ebb of breakfast and the cider-cup </l>
							<l>Came high debate: the others seated there </l>
							<l>Were Osric, spinner of fine sentences, </l>
							<l>A delicate insect creeping over life </l>
							<l>Feeding on molecules of floral breath, </l>
							<l>And weaving gossamer to trap the sun; </l>
							<l>Laertes ardent, rash, and radical; </l>
							<l>Discursive Rosencranz, grave Guildenstern, </l>
							<l>And he for whom the social meal was made — </l>
							<l>The polished priest, a tolerant listener, </l>
							<l>Disposed to give a hearing to the lost, </l>
							<l>And breakfast with them ere they went below. </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>From alpine metaphysic glaciers first </l>
							<l>The talk sprang copious; the themes were old, </l>
							<l>But so is human breath, so infant eyes, </l>
							<l>The daily nurslings of creative light. </l>
							<l>Small words held mighty meanings: Matter, Force, </l>
							<l>Self, Not-self, Being, Seeming, Space and Time — </l>
							<l>Plebeian toilers on the dusty road </l>
							<l>Of daily traffic, turned to Genii </l>
							<l>And cloudy giants darkening sun and moon. </l>
							<l>Creation was reversed in human talk: </l>
							<l>None said, " Let Darkness be, " but Darkness was; </l>
							<l>And in it weltered with Teutonic ease, </l>
							<l>An argumentative Leviathan, </l>
							<l>Blowing cascades from out his element, </l>
							<l>The thunderous Rosencranz, till </l>
							<l>" Truce, I beg! " </l>
							<l>Said Osric, with nice accent. " I abhor </l>
							<l>That battling of the ghosts, that strife of terms </l>
							<l>For utmost lack of colour, form, and breath, </l>
							<l>That tasteless squabbling called Philosophy: </l>
							<l>As if a blue-winged butterfly afloat </l>
							<l>For just three days above the Italian fields, </l>
							<l>Instead of sipping at the heart of flowers, </l>
							<l>Poising in sunshine, fluttering towards its bride, </l>
							<l>Should fast and speculate, considering </l>
							<l>What were if it were not? or what now is </l>
							<l>Instead of that which seems to be itself? </l>
							<l>Its deepest wisdom surely were to be </l>
							<l>A sipping, marrying, blue-winged butterfly; </l>
							<l>Since utmost speculation on itself </l>
							<l>Were but a three days' living of worse sort — </l>
							<l>A bruising struggle all within the bounds </l>
							<l>Of butterfly existence. " </l>
							<l>" I protest, " </l>
							<l>Burst in Laertes, " against arguments </l>
							<l>That start with calling me a butterfly, </l>
							<l>A bubble, spark, or other metaphor </l>
							<l>Which carries your conclusions as a phrase </l>
							<l>In quibbling law will carry property. </l>
							<l>Put a thin sucker for my human lips </l>
							<l>Fed at a mother's breast, who now needs food </l>
							<l>That I will earn for her; put bubbles blown </l>
							<l>From frothy thinking, for the joy, the love, </l>
							<l>The wants, the pity, and the fellowship </l>
							<l>(The ocean deeps I might say, were I bent </l>
							<l>On bandying metaphors) that make a man — </l>
							<l>Why, rhetoric brings within your easy reach </l>
							<l>Conclusions worthy of — a butterfly. </l>
							<l>The universe, I hold, is no charade, </l>
							<l>No acted pun unriddled by a word, </l>
							<l>Nor pain a decimal diminishing </l>
							<l>With hocus-pocus of a dot or nought. </l>
							<l>For those who know it, pain is solely pain: </l>
							<l>Not any letters of the alphabet </l>
							<l>Wrought syllogistically pattern-wise, </l>
							<l>Nor any cluster of fine images, </l>
							<l>Nor any missing of their figured dance </l>
							<l>By blundering molecules. Analysis </l>
							<l>May show you the right physic for the ill, </l>
							<l>Teaching the molecules to find their dance, </l>
							<l>But spare me your analogies, that hold </l>
							<l>Such insight as the figure of a crow </l>
							<l>And bar of music put to signify </l>
							<l>A crowbar. " </l>
							<l>Said the Priest, " There I agree — </l>
							<l>Would add that sacramental grace is grace </l>
							<l>Which to be known must first be felt, with all </l>
							<l>The strengthening influxes that come by prayer. </l>
							<l>I note this passingly — would not delay </l>
							<l>The conversation's tenor, save to hint </l>
							<l>That taking stand with Rosencranz one sees </l>
							<l>Final equivalence of all we name </l>
							<l>Our Good and Ill — their difference meanwhile </l>
							<l>Being inborn prejudice that plumps you down </l>
							<l>An Ego, brings a weight into your scale </l>
							<l>Forcing a standard. That resistless weight </l>
							<l>Obstinate, irremovable by thought, </l>
							<l>Persisting through disproof, an ache, a need </l>
							<l>That spaceless stays where sharp analysis </l>
							<l>Has shown a plenum filled without it — what </l>
							<l>If this, to use your phrase, were just that Being </l>
							<l>Not looking solely, grasping from the dark, </l>
							<l>Weighing the difference you call Ego? This </l>
							<l>Gives you persistence, regulates the flux </l>
							<l>With strict relation rooted in the All. </l>
							<l>Who is he of your late philosophers </l>
							<l>Takes the true name of Being to be Will? </l>
							<l>I — nay, the Church objects nought, is content: </l>
							<l>Reason has reached its utmost negative, </l>
							<l>Physic and metaphysic meet in the inane </l>
							<l>And backward shrink to intense prejudice, </l>
							<l>Making their absolute and homogene </l>
							<l>A loaded relative, a choice to be </l>
							<l>Whatever is — supposed: a What is not. </l>
							<l>The Church demands no more, has standing room </l>
							<l>And basis for her doctrine: this (no more) — </l>
							<l>That the strong bias which we name the Soul, </l>
							<l>Though fed and clad by dissoluble waves, </l>
							<l>Has antecedent quality, and rules </l>
							<l>By veto or consent the strife of thought, </l>
							<l>Making arbitrament that we call faith. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Here was brief silence, till young Hamlet spoke. </l>
							<l>" I crave direction, Father, how to know </l>
							<l>The sign of that imperative whose right </l>
							<l>To sway my act in face of thronging doubts </l>
							<l>Were an oracular gem in price beyond </l>
							<l>Urim and Thummim lost to Israel. </l>
							<l>That bias of the soul, that conquering die </l>
							<l>Loaded with golden emphasis of Will — </l>
							<l>How find it where resolve, once made, becomes </l>
							<l>The rash exclusion of an opposite </l>
							<l>Which draws the stronger as I turn aloof. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" I think I hear a bias in your words, " </l>
							<l>The Priest said mildly, — " that strong natural bent </l>
							<l>Which we call hunger. What more positive </l>
							<l>Than appetite? — of spirit or of flesh, </l>
							<l>I care not — " sense of need" were truer phrase. </l>
							<l>You hunger for authoritative right, </l>
							<l>And yet discern no difference of tones, </l>
							<l>No weight of rod that marks imperial rule? </l>
							<l>Laertes granting, I will put your case </l>
							<l>In analogic form: the doctors hold </l>
							<l>Hunger which gives no relish — save caprice </l>
							<l>That tasting venison fancies mellow pears — </l>
							<l>A symptom of disorder, and prescribe </l>
							<l>Strict discipline. Were I physician here </l>
							<l>I would prescribe that exercise of soul </l>
							<l>Which lies in full obedience: you ask, </l>
							<l>Obedience to what? The answer lies </l>
							<l>Within the word itself; for how obey </l>
							<l>What has no rule, asserts no absolute claim? </l>
							<l>Take inclination, taste — why, that is you, </l>
							<l>No rule above you. Science, reasoning </l>
							<l>On nature's order — they exist and move </l>
							<l>Solely by disputation, hold no pledge </l>
							<l>Of final consequence, but push the swing </l>
							<l>Where Epicurus and the Stoic sit </l>
							<l>In endless see-saw. One authority, </l>
							<l>And only one, says simply this, Obey: </l>
							<l>Place yourself in that current (test it so!) </l>
							<l>Of spiritual order where at least </l>
							<l>Lies promise of a high communion </l>
							<l>A Head informing members, Life that breathes </l>
							<l>With gift of forces over and above </l>
							<l>The plus of arithmetic interchange. </l>
							<l>" The Church too has a body," you object, </l>
							<l>" Can be dissected, put beneath the lens </l>
							<l>And shown the merest continuity </l>
							<l>Of all existence else beneath the sun." </l>
							<l>I grant you; but the lens will not disprove </l>
							<l>A presence which eludes it. Take your wit, </l>
							<l>Your highest passion, widest-reaching thought: </l>
							<l>Show their conditions if you will or can, </l>
							<l>But though you saw the final atom-dance </l>
							<l>Making each molecule that stands for sign </l>
							<l>Of love being present, where is still your love? </l>
							<l>How measure that, how certify its weight? </l>
							<l>And so I say, the body of the Church </l>
							<l>Carries a Presence, promises and gifts </l>
							<l>Never disproved — whose argument is found </l>
							<l>In lasting failure of the search elsewhere </l>
							<l>For what it holds to satisfy man's need. </l>
							<l>But I grow lengthy: my excuse must be </l>
							<l>Your question, Hamlet, which has probed right through </l>
							<l>To the pith of our belief. And I have robbed </l>
							<l>Myself of pleasure as a listener. </l>
							<l>'Tis noon, I see; and my appointment stands </l>
							<l>For half-past twelve with Voltimand. Good-bye. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Brief parting, brief regret — sincere, but quenched </l>
							<l>In fumes of best Havannah, which consoles </l>
							<l>For lack of other certitude. Then said, </l>
							<l>Mildly sarcastic, quiet Guildenstern: </l>
							<l>" I marvel how the Father gave new charm </l>
							<l>To weak conclusions: I was half convinced </l>
							<l>The poorest reasoner made the finest man, </l>
							<l>And held his logic lovelier for its limp. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" I fain would hear, " said Hamlet, " how you find </l>
							<l>A stronger footing than the Father gave. </l>
							<l>How base your self-resistance save on faith </l>
							<l>In some invisible Order, higher Right </l>
							<l>Than changing impulse. What does Reason bid? </l>
							<l>To take a fullest rationality </l>
							<l>What offers best solution: so the Church. </l>
							<l>Science, detecting hydrogen aflame </l>
							<l>Outside our firmament, leaves mystery </l>
							<l>Whole and untouched beyond; nay, in our blood </l>
							<l>And in the potent atoms of each germ </l>
							<l>The Secret lives — envelops, penetrates </l>
							<l>Whatever sense perceives or thought divines. </l>
							<l>Science, whose soul is explanation, halts </l>
							<l>With hostile front at mystery. The Church </l>
							<l>Takes mystery as her empire, brings its wealth </l>
							<l>Of possibility to fill the void </l>
							<l>'Twixt contradictions — warrants so a faith </l>
							<l>Defying sense and all its ruthless train </l>
							<l>Of arrogant " Therefores." Science with her lens </l>
							<l>Dissolves the Forms that made the other half </l>
							<l>Of all our love, which thenceforth widowed lives </l>
							<l>To gaze with maniac stare at what is not. </l>
							<l>The Church explains not, governs — feeds resolve </l>
							<l>By vision fraught with heart-experience </l>
							<l>And human yearning. " </l>
							<l>" Ay, " said Guildenstern. </l>
							<l>With friendly nod, " the Father, I can see, </l>
							<l>Has caught you up in his air-chariot. </l>
							<l>His thought takes rainbow-bridges, out of reach </l>
							<l>By solid obstacles, evaporates </l>
							<l>The coarse and common into subtilties, </l>
							<l>Insists that what is real in the Church </l>
							<l>Is something out of evidence, and begs </l>
							<l>(Just in parenthesis) you'll never mind </l>
							<l>What stares you in the face and bruises you. </l>
							<l>Why, by his method I could justify </l>
							<l>Each superstition and each tyranny </l>
							<l>That ever rode upon the back of man, </l>
							<l>Pretending fitness for his sole defence </l>
							<l>Against life's evil. How can aught subsist </l>
							<l>That holds no theory of gain or good? </l>
							<l>Despots with terror in their red right hand </l>
							<l>Must argue good to helpers and themselves, </l>
							<l>Must let submission hold a core of gain </l>
							<l>To make their slaves choose life. Their theory, </l>
							<l>Abstracting inconvenience of racks, </l>
							<l>Whip-lashes, dragonnades and all things coarse </l>
							<l>Inherent in the fact or concrete mass, </l>
							<l>Presents the pure idea — utmost good </l>
							<l>Secured by Order only to be found </l>
							<l>In strict subordination, hierarchy </l>
							<l>Of forces where, by nature's law, the strong </l>
							<l>Has rightful empire, rule of weaker proved </l>
							<l>Mere dissolution. What can you object? </l>
							<l>The Inquisition — if you turn away </l>
							<l>From narrow notice how the scent of gold </l>
							<l>Has guided sense of damning heresy — </l>
							<l>The Inquisition is sublime, is love </l>
							<l>Hindering the spread of poison in men's souls: </l>
							<l>The flames are nothing: only smaller pain </l>
							<l>To hinder greater, or the pain of one </l>
							<l>To save the many, such as throbs at heart </l>
							<l>Of every system born into the world. </l>
							<l>So of the Church as high communion </l>
							<l>Of Head with members, fount of spirit force </l>
							<l>Beyond the calculus, and carrying proof </l>
							<l>In her sole power to satisfy man's need: </l>
							<l>That seems ideal truth as clear as lines </l>
							<l>That, necessary though invisible, trace </l>
							<l>The balance of the planets and the sun — </l>
							<l>Until I find a hitch in that last claim. </l>
							<l>" To satisfy man's need." Sir, that depends: </l>
							<l>We settle first the measure of man's need </l>
							<l>Before we grant capacity to fill. </l>
							<l>John, James, or Thomas, you may satisfy: </l>
							<l>But since you choose ideals I demand </l>
							<l>Your Church shall satisfy ideal man, </l>
							<l>His utmost reason and his utmost love. </l>
							<l>And say these rest a-hungered — find no scheme </l>
							<l>Content them both, but hold the world accursed, </l>
							<l>A Calvary where Reason mocks at Love, </l>
							<l>And Love forsaken sends out orphan cries </l>
							<l>Hopeless of answer; still the soul remains </l>
							<l>Larger, diviner than your half-way Church, </l>
							<l>Which racks your reason into false consent, </l>
							<l>And soothes your Love with sops of selfishness. " </l>
							<l>" There I am with you, " cried Laertes. " What </l>
							<l>To me are any dictates, though they came </l>
							<l>With thunders from the Mount, if still within </l>
							<l>I see a higher Right, a higher Good </l>
							<l>Compelling love and worship? Though the earth </l>
							<l>Held force electric to discern and kill </l>
							<l>Each thinking rebel — what is martyrdom </l>
							<l>But death-defying utterance of belief, </l>
							<l>Which being mine remains my truth supreme </l>
							<l>Though solitary as the throb of pain </l>
							<l>Lying outside the pulses of the world? </l>
							<l>Obedience is good: ay, but to what? </l>
							<l>And for what ends? For say that I rebel </l>
							<l>Against your rule as devilish, or as rule </l>
							<l>Of thunder-guiding powers that deny </l>
							<l>Man's highest benefit: rebellion then </l>
							<l>Were strict obedience to another rule </l>
							<l>Which bids me flout your thunder. " </l>
							<l>" Lo you now! " </l>
							<l>Said Osric, delicately, " how you come, </l>
							<l>Laertes mine, with all your warring zeal </l>
							<l>As Python-slayer of the present age — </l>
							<l>Cleansing all social swamps by darting rays </l>
							<l>Of dubious doctrine, hot with energy </l>
							<l>Of private judgment and disgust for doubt — </l>
							<l>To state my thesis, which you most abhor </l>
							<l>When sung in Daphnis-notes beneath the pines </l>
							<l>To gentle rush of waters. Your belief — </l>
							<l>In essence what is it but simply Taste? </l>
							<l>I urge with you exemption from all claims </l>
							<l>That come from other than my proper will, </l>
							<l>An Ultimate within to balance yours, </l>
							<l>A solid meeting you, excluding you, </l>
							<l>Till you show fuller force by entering </l>
							<l>My spiritual space and crushing Me </l>
							<l>To a subordinate complement of You: </l>
							<l>Such ultimate must stand alike for all. </l>
							<l>Preach your crusade, then: all will join who like </l>
							<l>The hurly-burly of aggressive creeds; </l>
							<l>Still your unpleasant Ought, your itch to choose </l>
							<l>What grates upon the sense, is simply Taste, </l>
							<l>Differs, I think, from mine (permit the word, </l>
							<l>Discussion forces it) in being bad. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>The tone was too polite to breed offence, </l>
							<l>Showing a tolerance of what was " bad " </l>
							<l>Becoming courtiers. Louder Rosencranz </l>
							<l>Took up the ball with rougher movement, wont </l>
							<l>To show contempt for doting reasoners </l>
							<l>Who hugged some reasons with a preference, </l>
							<l>As warm Laertes did: he gave five puffs </l>
							<l>Intolerantly sceptical, then said, </l>
							<l>" Your human good, which you would make supreme, </l>
							<l>How do you know it? Has it shown its face </l>
							<l>In adamantine type, with features clear, </l>
							<l>As this republic, or that monarchy? </l>
							<l>As federal grouping, or municipal? </l>
							<l>Equality, or finely shaded lines </l>
							<l>Of social difference? ecstatic whirl </l>
							<l>And draught intense of passionate joy and pain, </l>
							<l>Or sober self-control that starves its youth </l>
							<l>And lives to wonder what the world calls joy? </l>
							<l>Is it in sympathy that shares men's pangs </l>
							<l>Or in cool brains that can explain them well? </l>
							<l>Is it in labour or in laziness? </l>
							<l>In training for the tug of rivalry </l>
							<l>To be admired, or in the admiring soul? </l>
							<l>In risk or certitude? In battling rage </l>
							<l>And hardy challenges of Protean luck, </l>
							<l>Or in a sleek and rural apathy </l>
							<l>Full fed with sameness? Pray define your Good </l>
							<l>Beyond rejection by majority; </l>
							<l>Next, how it may subsist without the Ill </l>
							<l>Which seems its only outline. Show a world </l>
							<l>Of pleasure not resisted; or a world </l>
							<l>Of pressure equalised, yet various </l>
							<l>In action formative; for that will serve </l>
							<l>As illustration of your human good — </l>
							<l>Which at its perfecting (your goal of hope) </l>
							<l>Will not be straight extinct, or fall to sleep </l>
							<l>In the deep bosom of the Unchangeable. </l>
							<l>What will you work for, then, and call it good </l>
							<l>With full and certain vision — good for aught </l>
							<l>Save partial ends which happen to be yours? </l>
							<l>How will you get your stringency to bind </l>
							<l>Thought or desire in demonstrated tracks </l>
							<l>Which are but waves within a balanced whole? </l>
							<l>Is " relative" the magic word that turns </l>
							<l>Your flux mercurial of good to gold? </l>
							<l>Why, that analysis at which you rage </l>
							<l>As anti-social force that sweeps you down </l>
							<l>The world in one cascade of molecules, </l>
							<l>Is brother " relative" — and grins at you </l>
							<l>Like any convict whom you thought to send </l>
							<l>Outside society, till this enlarged </l>
							<l>And meant New England and Australia too. </l>
							<l>The Absolute is your shadow, and the space </l>
							<l>Which you say might be real were you milled </l>
							<l>To curves pellicular, the thinnest thin, </l>
							<l>Equation of no thickness, is still you. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" Abstracting all that makes him clubbable, " </l>
							<l>Horatio interposed. But Rosencranz, </l>
							<l>Deaf as the angry turkey-cock whose ears </l>
							<l>Are plugged by swollen tissues when he scolds </l>
							<l>At men's pretensions: " Pooh, your " Relative" </l>
							<l>Shuts you in, hopeless, with your progeny </l>
							<l>As in a Hunger-tower; your social good, </l>
							<l>Like other deities by turn supreme, </l>
							<l>Is transient reflex of a prejudice, </l>
							<l>Anthology of causes and effects </l>
							<l>To suit the mood of fanatics who lead </l>
							<l>The mood of tribes or nations. I admit </l>
							<l>If you could show a sword, nay, chance of sword </l>
							<l>Hanging conspicuous to their inward eyes </l>
							<l>With edge so constant threatening as to sway </l>
							<l>All greed and lust by terror; and a law </l>
							<l>Clear-writ and proven as the law supreme </l>
							<l>Which that dread sword enforces — then your Right, </l>
							<l>Duty, or social Good, were it once brought </l>
							<l>To common measure with the potent law, </l>
							<l>Would dip the scale, would put unchanging marks </l>
							<l>Of wisdom or of folly on each deed, </l>
							<l>And warrant exhortation. Until then, </l>
							<l>Where is your standard or criterion? </l>
							<l>" What always, everywhere, by all men" — why, </l>
							<l>That were but Custom, and your system needs </l>
							<l>Ideals never yet incorporate, </l>
							<l>The imminent doom of Custom. Can you find </l>
							<l>Appeal beyond the sentience in each man? </l>
							<l>Frighten the blind with scarecrows? raise an awe </l>
							<l>Of things unseen where appetite commands </l>
							<l>Chambers of imagery in the soul </l>
							<l>At all its avenues? — You chant your hymns </l>
							<l>To Evolution, on your altar lay </l>
							<l>A sacred egg called Progress: have you proved </l>
							<l>A Best unique where all is relative, </l>
							<l>And where each change is loss as well as gain? </l>
							<l>The age of healthy Saurians, well supplied </l>
							<l>With heat and prey, will balance well enough </l>
							<l>A human age where maladies are strong </l>
							<l>And pleasures feeble; wealth a monster gorged </l>
							<l>Mid hungry populations; intellect </l>
							<l>Aproned in laboratories, bent on proof </l>
							<l>That this is that and both are good for nought </l>
							<l>Save feeding error through a weary life; </l>
							<l>While Art and Poesy struggle like poor ghosts </l>
							<l>To hinder cock-crow and the dreadful light, </l>
							<l>Lurking in darkness and the charnel-house, </l>
							<l>Or like two stalwart greybeards, imbecile </l>
							<l>With limbs still active, playing at belief </l>
							<l>That hunt the slipper, foot-ball, hide-and-seek, </l>
							<l>Are sweetly merry, donning pinafores </l>
							<l>And lisping emulously in their speech. </l>
							<l>O human race! Is this then all thy gain? — </l>
							<l>Working at disproof, playing at belief, </l>
							<l>Debate on causes, distaste of effects, </l>
							<l>Power to transmute all elements, and lack </l>
							<l>Of any power to sway the fatal skill </l>
							<l>And make thy lot aught else than rigid doom? </l>
							<l>The Saurians were better. — Guildenstern, </l>
							<l>Pass me the taper. Still the human curse </l>
							<l>Has mitigation in the best cigars. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Then swift Laertes, not without a glare </l>
							<l>Of leonine wrath, " I thank thee for that word: </l>
							<l>That one confession, were I Socrates, </l>
							<l>Should force you onward till you ran your head </l>
							<l>At your own image — flatly gave the lie </l>
							<l>To all your blasphemy of that human good </l>
							<l>Which bred and nourished you to sit at ease </l>
							<l>And learnedly deny it. Say the world </l>
							<l>Groans ever with the pangs of doubtful births: </l>
							<l>Say, life's a poor donation at the best — </l>
							<l>Wisdom a yearning after nothingness — </l>
							<l>Nature's great vision and the thrill supreme </l>
							<l>Of thought-fed passion but a weary play — </l>
							<l>I argue not against you. Who can prove </l>
							<l>Wit to be witty when with deeper ground </l>
							<l>Dulness intuitive declares wit dull? </l>
							<l>If life is worthless to you — why, it is. </l>
							<l>You only know how little love you feel </l>
							<l>To give you fellowship, how little force </l>
							<l>Responsive to the quality of things. </l>
							<l>Then end your life, throw off the unsought yoke. </l>
							<l>If not — if you remain to taste cigars, </l>
							<l>Choose racy diction, perorate at large </l>
							<l>With tacit scorn of meaner men who win </l>
							<l>No wreath or tripos — then admit at least </l>
							<l>A possible Better in the seeds of earth; </l>
							<l>Acknowledge debt to that laborious life </l>
							<l>Which, sifting evermore the mingled seeds, </l>
							<l>Testing the Possible with patient skill, </l>
							<l>And daring ill in presence of a good </l>
							<l>For futures to inherit, made your lot </l>
							<l>One you would choose rather than end it, nay, </l>
							<l>Rather than, say, some twenty million lots </l>
							<l>Of fellow-Britons toiling all to make </l>
							<l>That nation, that community, whereon </l>
							<l>You feed and thrive and talk philosophy. </l>
							<l>I am no optimist whose faith must hang </l>
							<l>On hard pretence that pain is beautiful </l>
							<l>And agony explained for men at ease </l>
							<l>By virtue's exercise in pitying it. </l>
							<l>But this I hold: that he who takes one gift </l>
							<l>Made for him by the hopeful work of man, </l>
							<l>Who tastes sweet bread, walks where he will unarmed, </l>
							<l>His shield and warrant the invisible law, </l>
							<l>Who owns a hearth and household charities, </l>
							<l>Who clothes his body and his sentient soul </l>
							<l>With skill and thoughts of men, and yet denies </l>
							<l>A human good worth toiling for, is cursed </l>
							<l>With worse negation than the poet feigned </l>
							<l>In Mephistopheles. The Devil spins </l>
							<l>His wire-drawn argument against all good </l>
							<l>With sense of brimstone as his private lot, </l>
							<l>And never drew a solace from the Earth. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Laertes fuming paused, and Guildenstern </l>
							<l>Took up with cooler skill the fusillade: </l>
							<l>" I meet your deadliest challenge, Rosencranz: — </l>
							<l>Where get, you say, a binding law, a rule </l>
							<l>Enforced by sanction, an Ideal throned </l>
							<l>With thunder in its hand? I answer, there </l>
							<l>Whence every faith and rule has drawn its force </l>
							<l>Since human consciousness awaking owned </l>
							<l>An Outward, whose unconquerable sway </l>
							<l>Resisted first and then subdued desire </l>
							<l>By pressure of the dire Impossible </l>
							<l>Urging to possible ends the active soul </l>
							<l>And shaping so its terror and its love. </l>
							<l>Why, you have said it — threats and promises </l>
							<l>Depend on each man's sentience for their force: </l>
							<l>All sacred rules, imagined or revealed, </l>
							<l>Can have no form or potency apart </l>
							<l>From the percipient and emotive mind. </l>
							<l>God, duty, love, submission, fellowship, </l>
							<l>Must first be framed in man, as music is, </l>
							<l>Before they live outside him as a law. </l>
							<l>And still they grow and shape themselves anew, </l>
							<l>With fuller concentration in their life </l>
							<l>Of inward and of outward energies </l>
							<l>Blending to make the last result called Man, </l>
							<l>Which means, not this or that philosopher </l>
							<l>Looking through beauty into blankness, not </l>
							<l>The swindler who has sent his fruitful lie </l>
							<l>By the last telegram: it means the tide </l>
							<l>Of needs reciprocal, toil, trust, and love — </l>
							<l>The surging multitude of human claims </l>
							<l>Which make " a presence not to be put by" </l>
							<l>Above the horizon of the general soul. </l>
							<l>Is inward Reason shrunk to subtleties, </l>
							<l>And inward wisdom pining passion-starved? — </l>
							<l>The outward Reason has the world in store, </l>
							<l>Regenerates passion with the stress of want, </l>
							<l>Regenerates knowledge with discovery, </l>
							<l>Shows sly rapacious Self a blunderer, </l>
							<l>Widens dependence, knits the social whole </l>
							<l>In sensible relation more defined. </l>
							<l>Do Boards and dirty-handed millionaires </l>
							<l>Govern the planetary system? — sway </l>
							<l>The pressure of the Universe? — decide </l>
							<l>That man henceforth shall retrogress to ape, </l>
							<l>Emptied of every sympathetic thrill </l>
							<l>The All has wrought in him? dam up henceforth </l>
							<l>The flood of human claims as private force </l>
							<l>To turn their wheels and make a private hell </l>
							<l>For fish-pond to their mercantile domain? </l>
							<l>What are they but a parasitic growth </l>
							<l>On the vast real and ideal world </l>
							<l>Of man and nature blent in one divine? </l>
							<l>Why, take your closing dirge — say evil grows </l>
							<l>And good is dwindling; science mere decay, </l>
							<l>Mere dissolution of ideal wholes </l>
							<l>Which through the ages past alone have made </l>
							<l>The earth and firmament of human faith; </l>
							<l>Say, the small arc of Being we call man </l>
							<l>Is near its mergence, what seems growing life </l>
							<l>Nought but a hurrying change towards lower types, </l>
							<l>The ready rankness of degeneracy. </l>
							<l>Well, they who mourn for the world's dying good </l>
							<l>May take their common sorrows for a rock, </l>
							<l>On it erect religion and a church, </l>
							<l>A worship, rites, and passionate piety — </l>
							<l>The worship of the Best though crucified </l>
							<l>And God-forsaken in its dying pangs; </l>
							<l>The sacramental rites of fellowship </l>
							<l>In common woe; visions that purify </l>
							<l>Through admiration and despairing love </l>
							<l>Which keep their spiritual life intact </l>
							<l>Beneath the murderous clutches of disproof </l>
							<l>And feed a martyr-strength. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" Religion high! " </l>
							<l>(Rosencranz here) " but with communicants </l>
							<l>Few as the cedars upon Lebanon — </l>
							<l>A child might count them. What the world demands </l>
							<l>Is faith coercive of the multitude. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" Tush, Guildenstern, you granted him too much, " </l>
							<l>Burst in Laertes; " I will never grant </l>
							<l>One inch of law to feeble blasphemies </l>
							<l>Which hold no higher ratio to life — </l>
							<l>Full vigorous human life that peopled earth </l>
							<l>And wrought and fought and loved and bravely died — </l>
							<l>Than the sick morning glooms of debauchees. </l>
							<l>Old nations breed old children, wizened babes </l>
							<l>Whose youth is languid and incredulous, </l>
							<l>Weary of life without the will to die; </l>
							<l>Their passions visionary appetites </l>
							<l>Of bloodless spectres wailing that the world </l>
							<l>For lack of substance slips from out their grasp; </l>
							<l>Their thoughts the withered husks of all things dead, </l>
							<l>Holding no force of germs instinct with life, </l>
							<l>Which never hesitates but moves and grows. </l>
							<l>Yet hear them boast in screams their godlike ill, </l>
							<l>Excess of knowing! Fie on you, Rosencranz! </l>
							<l>You lend your brains and fine-dividing tongue </l>
							<l>For bass-notes to this shrivelled crudity, </l>
							<l>This immature decrepitude that strains </l>
							<l>To fill our ears and claim the prize of strength </l>
							<l>For mere unmanliness. Out on them all! — </l>
							<l>Wits, puling minstrels, and philosophers, </l>
							<l>Who living softly prate of suicide, </l>
							<l>And suck the commonwealth to feed their ease </l>
							<l>While they vent epigrams and threnodies, </l>
							<l>Mocking or wailing all the eager work </l>
							<l>Which makes that public store whereon they feed. </l>
							<l>Is wisdom flattened sense and mere distaste? </l>
							<l>Why, any superstition warm with love, </l>
							<l>Inspired with purpose, wild with energy </l>
							<l>That streams resistless through its ready frame, </l>
							<l>Has more of human truth within its life </l>
							<l>Than souls that look through colour into nought, — </l>
							<l>Whose brain, too unimpassioned for delight, </l>
							<l>Has feeble ticklings of a vanity </l>
							<l>Which finds the universe beneath its mark, </l>
							<l>And scorning the blue heavens as merely blue </l>
							<l>Can only say, " What then?" — pre-eminent </l>
							<l>In wondrous want of likeness to their kind, </l>
							<l>Founding that worship of sterility </l>
							<l>Whose one supreme is vacillating Will </l>
							<l>Which makes the Light, then says " 'Twere better not." " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>Here rash Laertes brought his Handel-strain </l>
							<l>As of some angry Polypheme, to pause; </l>
							<l>And Osric, shocked at ardours out of taste, </l>
							<l>Relieved the audience with a tenor voice </l>
							<l>And delicate delivery. </l>
							<l>" For me, </l>
							<l>I range myself in line with Rosencranz </l>
							<l>Against all schemes, religious or profane, </l>
							<l>That flaunt a Good as pretext for a lash </l>
							<l>To flog us all who have the better taste, </l>
							<l>Into conformity, requiring me </l>
							<l>At peril of the thong and sharp disgrace </l>
							<l>To care how mere Philistines pass their lives; </l>
							<l>Whether the English pauper-total grows </l>
							<l>From one to two before the noughts; how far </l>
							<l>Teuton will outbreed Roman; if the class </l>
							<l>Of proletaires will make a federal band </l>
							<l>To bind all Europe and America, </l>
							<l>Throw, in their wrestling, every government, </l>
							<l>Snatch the world's purse and keep the guillotine: </l>
							<l>Or else (admitting these are casualties) </l>
							<l>Driving my soul with scientific hail </l>
							<l>That shuts the landscape out with particles; </l>
							<l>Insisting that the Palingenesis </l>
							<l>Means telegraphs and measure of the rate </l>
							<l>At which the stars move — nobody knows where. </l>
							<l>So far, my Rosencranz, we are at one. </l>
							<l>But not when you blaspheme the life of Art, </l>
							<l>The sweet perennial youth of Poesy, </l>
							<l>Which asks no logic but its sensuous growth, </l>
							<l>No right but loveliness; which fearless strolls </l>
							<l>Betwixt the burning mountain and the sea, </l>
							<l>Reckless of earthquake and the lava stream, </l>
							<l>Filling its hour with beauty. It knows nought </l>
							<l>Of bitter strife, denial, grim resolve, </l>
							<l>Sour resignation, busy emphasis </l>
							<l>Of fresh illusions named the new-born True, </l>
							<l>Old Error's latest child; but as a lake </l>
							<l>Images all things, yet within its depths </l>
							<l>Dreams them all lovelier — thrills with sound </l>
							<l>And makes a harp of plenteous liquid chords — </l>
							<l>So Art or Poesy: we its votaries </l>
							<l>Are the Olympians, fortunately born </l>
							<l>From the elemental mixture; 'tis our lot </l>
							<l>To pass more swiftly than the Delian God, </l>
							<l>But still the earth breaks into flowers for us, </l>
							<l>And mortal sorrows when they reach our ears </l>
							<l>Are dying falls to melody divine. </l>
							<l>Hatred, war, vice, crime, sin, those human storms, </l>
							<l>Cyclones, floods, what you will — outbursts of force — </l>
							<l>Feed art with contrast, give the grander touch </l>
							<l>To the master's pencil and the poet's song, </l>
							<l>Serve as Vesuvian fires or navies tossed </l>
							<l>On yawning waters, which when viewed afar </l>
							<l>Deepen the calm sublime of those choice souls </l>
							<l>Who keep the heights of poesy and turn </l>
							<l>A fleckless mirror to the various world, </l>
							<l>Giving its many-named and fitful flux </l>
							<l>An imaged, harmless, spiritual life, </l>
							<l>With pure selection, native to art's frame, </l>
							<l>Of beauty only, save its minor scale </l>
							<l>Of ill and pain to give the ideal joy </l>
							<l>A keener edge. This is a mongrel globe; </l>
							<l>All finer being wrought from its coarse earth </l>
							<l>Is but accepted privilege: what else </l>
							<l>Your boasted virtue, which proclaims itself </l>
							<l>A good above the average consciousness? </l>
							<l>Nature exists by partiality </l>
							<l>(Each planet's poise must carry two extremes </l>
							<l>With verging breadths of minor wretchedness): </l>
							<l>We are her favourites and accept our wings. </l>
							<l>For your accusal, Rosencranz, that art </l>
							<l>Shares in the dread and weakness of the time, </l>
							<l>I hold it null; since art or poesy pure, </l>
							<l>Being blameless by all standards save her own, </l>
							<l>Takes no account of modern or antique </l>
							<l>In morals, science, or philosophy: </l>
							<l>No dull elenchus makes a yoke for her, </l>
							<l>Whose law and measure are the sweet consent </l>
							<l>Of sensibilities that move apart </l>
							<l>From rise or fall of systems, states or creeds — </l>
							<l>Apart from what Philistines call man's weal. " </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" Ay, we all know those votaries of the Muse </l>
							<l>Ravished with singing till they quite forgot </l>
							<l>Their manhood, sang, and gaped, and took no food, </l>
							<l>Then died of emptiness, and for reward </l>
							<l>Lived on as grasshoppers " — Laertes thus: </l>
							<l>But then he checked himself as one who feels </l>
							<l>His muscles dangerous, and Guildenstern </l>
							<l>Filled up the pause with calmer confidence. </l>
						</lg>
						<lg>
							<l>" You use your wings, my Osric, poise yourself </l>
							<l>Safely outside all reach of argument, </l>
							<l>Then dogmatise at will (a method known </l>
							<l>To ancient women and philosophers, </l>
							<l>Nay, to Philistines whom you most abhor); </l>
							<l>Else, could an arrow reach you, I should ask </l>
							<l>Whence came taste, beauty, sensibilities </l>
							<l>Refined to preference infallible? </l>
							<l>Doubtless, ye're gods — these odours ye inhale, </l>
							<l>A sacrificial scent. But how, I pray, </l>
							<l>Are odours made, if not by gradual change </l>
							<l>Of sense or substance? Is your beautiful </l>
							<l>A seedless, rootless flower, or has it grown </l>
							<l>With human growth, which means the rising sum </l>
							<l>Of human struggle, order, knowledge? — sense </l>
							<l>Trained to a fuller record, more exact — </l>
							<l>To truer guidance of each passionate force? </l>
							<l>Get me your roseate flesh without the blood; </l>
							<l>Get fine aromas without structure wrought </l>
							<l>From simpler being into manifold: </l>
							<l>Then and then only flaunt your Beautiful </l>
							<l>As what can live apart from thought, creeds, states, </l>
							<l>Which mean life's structure. Osric, I beseech — </l>
							<l>The infallible should be more catholic — </l>
							<l>Join in a war-dance with the cannibals, </l>
							<l>Hear Chinese music, love a face tattooed, </l>
							<l>Give adoration to a pointed skull, </l>
							<l>And think the Hindu Siva looks divine: </l>
							<l>'Tis art, 'tis poesy. Say, you object: </l>
							<l>How came you by that lofty dissidence, </l>
							<l>If not through changes in the social man </l>
							<l>Widening his consciousness from Here and Now </l>
							<l>To larger wholes beyond the reach of sense; </l>
							<l>Controlling to a fuller harmony </l>
							<l>The thrill of passion and the rule of fact; </l>
							<l>And paling false ideals in the light </l>
							<l>Of full-rayed sensibilities which blend </l>
							<l>Truth and desire? Taste, beauty, what are they </l>
							<l>But the soul's choice towards perfect bias wrought </l>
							<l>By finer balance of a fuller growth — </l>
							<l>Sense brought to subtlest metamorphosis </l>
							<l>Through love, thought, joy — the general human stor</l>
