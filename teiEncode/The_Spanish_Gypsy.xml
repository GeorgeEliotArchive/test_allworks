            <l>'Tis the warm South, where Europe spreads her lands</l>
            <l>Like fretted leaflets, breathing on the deep : </l>
            <l>Broad-breasted Spain, leaning with equal love </l>
            <l>On the Mid Sea that moans with memories, </l>
            <l>And on the untravelled Ocean's restless tides. </l>
            <l>This river, shadowed by the battlements </l>
            <l>And gleaming silvery towards the northern sky, </l>
            <l>Feeds the famed stream that waters Andalus </l>
            <l>And loiters, amorous of the fragrant air, </l>
            <l>By Córdova and Seville to the bay </l>
            <l>Fronting Algarva and the wandering flood </l>
            <l>Of Guadiana. This deep mountain gorge </l>
            <l>Slopes widening on the olive-pluméd plains </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Of fair Granáda : one far-stretching arm </l>
            <l>Points to Elvira, one to eastward heights </l>
            <l>Of Alpujarras where the new-bathed Day </l>
            <l>With oriflamme uplifted o'er the peaks </l>
            <l>Saddens the breasts of northward-looking snows </l>
            <l>That loved the night, and soared with soaring stars; </l>
            <l>Flashing the signals of his nearing swiftness </l>
            <l>From Almería's purple-shadowed bay </l>
            <l>On to the far-off rocks that gaze and glowOn </l>
            <l>to Alhambra, strong and ruddy hea1t </l>
            <l>Of glorious Morisma, gasping now, </l>
            <l>A maiméd giant in his agony. </l>
            <l>This town that dips its feet within the stream, </l>
            <l>And seems to sit a tower-crowned Cybele, </l>
            <l>Spreading her ample robe adown the rocks, </l>
            <l>Is rich Bedmár : 'twas Moorish long ago, </l>
            <l>But now the Cross is sparkling on the Mosque, </l>
            <l>And bells make Catholic the trembling air. </l>
            <l>The fortress gleams in Spanish sunshine now </l>
            <l>('Tis south a mile before the rays are Moorish)</l>
            <l>Hereditary jewel, agraffe bright </l>
            <l>On all the many-titled privilege </l>
            <l>Of young Duke Silva. No Castilian knight </l>
            <l>That serves Queen Isabel has higher charge; </l>
            <l>For near this frontier sits the Moorish king, </l>
            <l>Not Boabdil the waverer, who usurps </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A throne he trembles in, and fawning licks </l>
            <l>The feet of conquerors, but that fierce lion </l>
            <l>Grisly El Zagal, who has made his lair </l>
            <l>In Guadix' fort, and rushing thence with strength, </l>
            <l>Half his own fierceness, half the untainted heart </l>
            <l>Of mountain bands that fight for holiday, </l>
            <l>Wastes the fair lands that lie by Alcalá, </l>
            <l>Wreathing his horse's neck with Christian heads. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>To keep the Christian frontier-such high trust </l>
            <l>Is young Duke Silva's; and the time is great. </l>
            <l>(What times are little? To the sentinel </l>
            <l>That hour is regal when he mounts on guard.) </l>
            <l>The fifteenth century since the Man Divine </l>
            <l>Taught and was hated in Capernaum </l>
            <l>Is near its end-is falling as a husk </l>
            <l>Away from all the fruit its years have riped. </l>
            <l>The Moslem faith, now flickering like a torch </l>
            <l>In a night struggle on this shore of Spain, </l>
            <l>Glares, a broad column of advancing flame, </l>
            <l>Along the Danube and the Illyrian shore </l>
            <l>Far into Italy, where eager monks, </l>
            <l>Who watch in dreams and dream the while they </l>
            <l>watch, </l>
            <l>See Christ grow paler in the baleful light, </l>
            <l>Crying again the cry of the forsaken. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But faith, the stronger for extremity, </l>
            <l>Becomes prophetic, hears the far-Off tread </l>
            <l>Of western chivalry, sees downward sweep </l>
            <l>The archangel Michael with the gleaming sword, </l>
            <l>And listens for the shriek of hurrying fiends </l>
            <l>Chased from their revels in God's sanctuary. </l>
            <l>So trusts the monk, and lifts appealing eyes </l>
            <l>To the high dome, the Church's firmament, </l>
            <l>Where the blue light-pierced curtain, rolled away, </l>
            <l>Reveals the throne and Him who sits thereon. </l>
            <l>So trust the men whose best hope for the world </l>
            <l>Is ever that the world is near its end : </l>
            <l>Impatient of the stars that keep their course </l>
            <l>And make no pathway for the coming Judge. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But other futures stir the world's great heart, </l>
            <l>The West now enters on the heritage </l>
            <l>Won from the tombs of mighty ancestors, </l>
            <l>The seeds, the gold, the gems, the silent harps </l>
            <l>That lay deep buried with the memories </l>
            <l>Of old renown. </l>
            <l>No more, as once in sunny Avignon, </l>
            <l>The poet-scholar spreads the Homeric page, </l>
            <l>And gazes sadly, like the deaf at song; </l>
            <l>For now the old epic voices ring again </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And vibrate with the beat and melody</l>
            <l>Stirred by the warmth of old Ionian days.</l>
            <l>The martyred sage, the Attic orator,</l>
            <l>Immortally incarnate, like the gods,</l>
            <l>In spiritual bodies, wingéd words</l>
            <l>Holding a universe impalpable,</l>
            <l>Find a new audience. For evermore,</l>
            <l>With grander resurrection than was feigned</l>
            <l>Of Attila's fierce Huns, the soul of Greece</l>
            <l>Conquers the bulk of Persia. The maimed form</l>
            <l>Of calmly-joyous beauty, marble-limbed,</l>
            <l>Yet breathing with the thought that shaped its</l>
            <l>lips,</l>
            <l>Looks mild reproach from out its opened grave</l>
            <l>At creeds of terror; and the vine-wreathed god</l>
            <l>Fronts the pierced Image with the ·crown of thorns.</l>
            <l>The soul of man is widening towards the past :</l>
            <l>No longer hanging at the breast of life</l>
            <l>Feeding in blindness to his parentageQuenching</l>
            <l>all wonder with Omnipotence,</l>
            <l>Praising a name with indolent piety-</l>
            <l>He spells the record of his long descent,</l>
            <l>More largely conscious of the life that was.</l>
            <l>And from the height that shows where morning</l>
            <l>shone</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>On far-off summits pale and gloomy now,</l>
            <l>The horizon widens round him, and the west</l>
            <l>Looks vast with untracked waves whereon his gaze</l>
            <l>Follows the flight of the swift-vanished bird</l>
            <l>That like the sunken sun is mirrored still</l>
            <l>Upon the yearning soul within the eye.</l>
            <l>And so in Córdova through patient nights</l>
            <l>Columbus watches, or he sails in dreams</l>
            <l>Between the setting stars and finds new day;</l>
            <l>Then wakes again to the old weary days,</l>
            <l>Girds on the cord and frock of pale Saint Francis,</l>
            <l>And like him zealous pleads with foolish men.</l>
            <l>"I ask but for a million maravedis:</l>
            <l>Give me three caravels to find a world,</l>
            <l>New shores, new realms, new soldiers for the Cross.</l>
            <l>Son cosas grandes !" Thus he pleads in vain;</l>
            <l>Yet faints not utterly, but pleads anew,</l>
            <l>Thinking, "God means it, and has chosen me."</l>
            <l>For this man is the pulse of all mankind</l>
            <l>Feeding an embryo future, offspring strange</l>
            <l>Of the fond Present, that with mother-prayers</l>
            <l>And mother-fancies looks for championship</l>
            <l>Of all her loved beliefs and old-world ways</l>
            <l>From that young Time she bears within her womb.</l>
            <l>The sacred places shall be purged again,</l>
            <l>The Turk converted, and the Holy Church,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Like the mild Virgin with the outspread robe, </l>
            <l>Shall fold all tongues and nations lovingly . </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But since God works by armies, who shall be </l>
            <l>The modem Cyrus? Is it France most Christian, </l>
            <l>Who with his lilies and brocaded knights, </l>
            <l>French oaths, French vices, and the newest style </l>
            <l>Of out-puffed sleeve, shall pass from west to east, </l>
            <l>A winnowing fan to purify the seed </l>
            <l>For fair millennial harvests soon to come? </l>
            <l>Or is not Spain the land of chosen warriors ?… </l>
            <l>Crusaders consecrated from the womb, </l>
            <l>Carrying the sword-cross stamped upon their souls </l>
            <l>By the long yearnings of a nation's life, </l>
            <l>Through all the seven patient centuries </l>
            <l>Since first Pelayo and his resolute band </l>
            <l>Trusted the God within their Gothic hearts </l>
            <l>At Covadunga, and defied Mahound; </l>
            <l>Beginning so the Holy War of Spain </l>
            <l>That now is panting with the eagerness </l>
            <l>Of labour near its end. The silver cross </l>
            <l>Glitters o'er Malaga and streams dread light </l>
            <l>On Moslem galleys, turning all their stores </l>
            <l>From threats to gifts. What Spanish knight is he </l>
            <l>Who, living now, holds it not shame to live </l>
            <l>Apart from that hereditary battle </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Which needs his sword? Castilian gentlemen</l>
            <l>Choose not their task…they choose to do it well.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The time is great, and greater no man's trust</l>
            <l>Than bis who keeps the fortress for his king,</l>
            <l>Wearing great honours as some delicate robe</l>
            <l>Brocaded o'er with names 'twere sin to tarnish.</l>
            <l>Born de la Cerda, Calatravan knight,</l>
            <l>Count of Segura, fourth Duke of Bedmár,</l>
            <l>Offshoot from that high stock of old Castile</l>
            <l>Whose topmost branch is proud Medina Celi-</l>
            <l>Such titles with their blazonry are his</l>
            <l>Who keeps this fortress, its sworn governor,</l>
            <l>Lord of the valley, master of the town,</l>
            <l>Commanding whom he will, himself commanded</l>
            <l>By Christ his Lord who sees him from the Cross</l>
            <l>And from bright heaven where the Mother pleads;-</l>
            <l>By good Saint James upon the milk-white steed,</l>
            <l>Who leaves his bliss to fight for chosen Spain;-</l>
            <l>By the dead gaze of all his ancestors;-</l>
            <l>And by the mystery of his Spanish blood</l>
            <l>Charged with the awe and glories of the past.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>See now with soldiers in his front and rear</l>
            <l>He winds at evening through the narrow streets</l>
            <l>That toward the Castle gate climb devious :</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>His charger, of fine Andalusian stock,</l>
            <l>An Indian beauty, black but delicate,</l>
            <l>Is conscious of the herald trumpet note,</l>
            <l>The gathering glances, and familiar ways</l>
            <l>That lead fast homeward: she forgets fatigue,</l>
            <l>And at the light touch of the master's spur</l>
            <l>Thrills with the zeal to bear him royally,</l>
            <l>Arches her neck and clambers up the stones</l>
            <l>As if disdainful of the difficult steep.</l>
            <l>Night-black the charger, black the rider's plume,</l>
            <l>But all between is bright with morning huesSeems</l>
            <l>ivory and gold and deep blue gems,</l>
            <l>And starry flashing steel and pale vermilion,</l>
            <l>All set in jasper : on his surcoat white</l>
            <l>Glitter the sword-belt and the jewelled hilt,</l>
            <l>Red on the back and breast the holy cross,</l>
            <l>And 'twixt tho helmet and the soft-spun white</l>
            <l>Thick tawny wavelets like the lion's mane</l>
            <l>Turn backward from his brow, pale, wide, erect,</l>
            <l>Shadowing blue eyes…blue as the rain-washed sky</l>
            <l>That braced the early stem of Gothic kings</l>
            <l>He claims for ancestry. A goodly knight,</l>
            <l>A noble caballero, broad of chest</l>
            <l>And long of limb. So much the August sun,</l>
            <l>Now in the west but shooting half its beams</l>
            <l>Past a dark rocky profile toward the plain,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>At windings of the path across the slope</l>
            <l>Makes suddenly luminous for all who see :</l>
            <l>For women smiling from the terraced roofs;</l>
            <l>For boys that prone on trucks with head up-propped</l>
            <l>Lazy and curious, stare irreverent;</l>
            <l>For men who make obeisance with degrees</l>
            <l>Of good-will shading towards servility,</l>
            <l>Where good-will ends and secret fear begins</l>
            <l>And curses, too, low-muttered through the teeth,</l>
            <l>Explanatory to the God of Shem.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Five, grouped within a whitened tavern court</l>
            <l>Of Moorish fashion, where the trellised vines</l>
            <l>Purpling above their heads make odorous shade,</l>
            <l>Note through the open door the passers-by,</l>
            <l>Getting some rills of novelty to speed</l>
            <l>The lagging stream of talk and help the wine.</l>
            <l>'Tis Christian to drink wine : whoso denies</l>
            <l>His flesh at bidding save of Holy Church,</l>
            <l>Let him beware and take to Christian sins</l>
            <l>Lest he be taxed with Moslem sanctity.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The souls are five, the talkers only three.</l>
            <l>(No time, most tainted by wrong faith and rule,</l>
            <l>But holds some listeners and dumb animals.)</l>
            <l>MINE HOST is one : he with the well-arched nose,</l>
            <l>His charger, of fine Andalusian stock, </l>
            <l>An Indian beauty, black but delicate, </l>
            <l>Is conscious of the herald trumpet note, </l>
            <l>The gathering glances, and familiar ways </l>
            <l>That lead fast homeward: she forgets fatigue, </l>
            <l>And at the light touch of the master's spur </l>
            <l>Thrills with the zeal to bear him royally, </l>
            <l>Arches her neck and clambers up the stones </l>
            <l>As if disdainful of the difficult steep. </l>
            <l>Night-black the charger, black the rider's plume, </l>
            <l>But all between is bright with morning huesSeems </l>
            <l>ivory and gold and deep blue gems, </l>
            <l>And starry flashing steel and pale vermilion, </l>
            <l>All set in jasper : on his surcoat white </l>
            <l>Glitter the sword-belt and the jewelled hilt, </l>
            <l>Red on the back and breast the holy cross, </l>
            <l>And 'twixt tho helmet and the soft-spun white </l>
            <l>Thick tawny wavelets like the lion's mane </l>
            <l>Turn backward from his brow, pale, wide, erect, </l>
            <l>Shadowing blue eyes…blue as the rain-washed sky </l>
            <l>That braced the early stem of Gothic kings </l>
            <l>He claims for ancestry. A goodly knight, </l>
            <l>A noble caballero, broad of chest </l>
            <l>And long of limb. So much the August sun, </l>
            <l>Now in the west but shooting half its beams </l>
            <l>Past a dark rocky profile toward the plain, </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Soft-eyed, fat-handed, loving men for nought</l>
            <l>But his own humour, patting old and young</l>
            <l>Upon the back, and mentioning the cost</l>
            <l>With confidential blandness, as a tax</l>
            <l>That he collected much against his will</l>
            <l>From Spaniards who were all his bosom friends :</l>
            <l>Warranted Christian-else how keep an inn,</l>
            <l>Which calling asks true faith? though like his wine</l>
            <l>Of cheaper sort, a trifle over-new.</l>
            <l>His father was a convert, chose the chrism</l>
            <l>As men choose physic, kept his chimney warm</l>
            <l>With smokiest wood upon a Saturday,</l>
            <l>Counted his gains and grudges on a chaplet,</l>
            <l>And crossed himself asleep for fear of spies;</l>
            <l>Trusting the God of Israel would see</l>
            <l>'Twas Christian tyranny that made him base.</l>
            <l>Our host his son was born ten years too soon,</l>
            <l>Had heard his mother call him Ephraim,</l>
            <l>Knew holy things from common, thought it sin</l>
            <l>To feast on days when Israel's children mourned,</l>
            <l>So had to be converted with his sire,</l>
            <l>To doff the awe he learned as Ephraim,</l>
            <l>And suit his manners to a Christian name.</l>
            <l>But infant awe, that unborn moving thing,</l>
            <l>Dies with what nourished it, can never rise</l>
            <l>From the dead womb and walk and seek new pasture.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Thus baptism seemed to him a merry game</l>
            <l>Not tried before, all sacraments a mode</l>
            <l>Of doing homage for one's property,</l>
            <l>And all religions a queer human whim</l>
            <l>Or else a vice, according to degrees :</l>
            <l>As, 'tis a whim to like your chestnuts hot,</l>
            <l>Burn your own mouth and draw your face awry,</l>
            <l>A vice to pelt frogs with them-animals</l>
            <l>Content to take life coolly. And Lorenzo</l>
            <l>Would have all lives made easy, even lives</l>
            <l>Of spiders and inquisitors, yet still</l>
            <l>Wishing so well to flies and Moors and Jews</l>
            <l>He rather wished the others easy death;</l>
            <l>For loving all men clearly was deferred</l>
            <l>Till all men loved each other. Such mine Host,</l>
            <l>With chiselled smile caressing Seneca,</l>
            <l>The solemn mastiff leaning on his knee.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>His right-hand guest is solemn as the dog,</l>
            <l>Square-faced and massive: BLASCO is his name,</l>
            <l>A prosperous silversmith from Aragon;</l>
            <l>In speech not silvery, rather tuned as notes</l>
            <l>From a deep vessel made of plenteous iron,</l>
            <l>Or some great bell of slow but certain swing</l>
            <l>That, if you only wait, will tell the hour</l>
            <l>As well as flippant clocks that strike in haste</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And set off chiming a superfluous tune-</l>
            <l>Like JUAN there, the spare man with the lute, </l>
            <l>Who makes you dizzy with his rapid tongue, </l>
            <l>Whirring athwart your mind with comment swift </l>
            <l>On speech you would have finished by-and-by, </l>
            <l>Shooting your bird for you while you are loading, </l>
            <l>Cheapening your wisdom as a pattern known, </l>
            <l>Woven by any shuttle on demand. </l>
            <l>Can never sit quite still, too : sees a wasp </l>
            <l>And kills it with a movement like a flash; </l>
            <l>Whistles low notes or seems to thrum his lute </l>
            <l>As a mere hyphen 'twixt two syllables </l>
            <l>Of any steadier man; walks up and down </l>
            <l>And snuffs the orange flowers and shoots a pea </l>
            <l>To hit a streak of light let through the awning. </l>
            <l>Has a queer face : eyes large as plums, a nose </l>
            <l>Small, round, uneven, like a bit of wax </l>
            <l>Melted and cooled by chance. Thin-fingered, lithe, </l>
            <l>And as a squirrel noiseless, startling men </l>
            <l>Only by quickness. In his speech and look </l>
            <l>A touch of graceful wildness, as of things </l>
            <l>Not trained or tamed for uses of the world; </l>
            <l>Most like the Fauns that roamed in days of old </l>
            <l>About the listening whispering woods, and shared </l>
            <l>The subtler sense of sylvan ears and eyes </l>
            <l>Undulled by scheming thought, yet joined the rout </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Of men and women on the festal days,</l>
            <l>And played the syrinx too, and knew love's pains,</l>
            <l>Turning their anguish into melody.</l>
            <l>For Juan was a minstrel still, in times</l>
            <l>When minstrelsy was held a thing outworn.</l>
            <l>Spirits seem buried and their epitaph</l>
            <l>Is writ in Latin by severest pens,</l>
            <l>Yet still they flit above the trodden grave</l>
            <l>And find new bodies, animating them</l>
            <l>In quaint and ghostly way with antique souls.</l>
            <l>So Juan was a troubadour revived,</l>
            <l>Freshening life's dusty road with babbling rills</l>
            <l>Of wit and song, living 'mid harnessed men</l>
            <l>With limbs ungalled by armour, ready so</l>
            <l>To soothe them weary, and to cheer them sad.</l>
            <l>Guest at the board, companion in the camp,</l>
            <l>A crystal mirror to the life around,</l>
            <l>Flashing the comment keen of simple fact</l>
            <l>Defined in words; lending brief lyric voice</l>
            <l>To grief and sadness; hardly taking note</l>
            <l>Of difference betwixt his own and others';</l>
            <l>But rather singing as a listener</l>
            <l>To the deep moans, the cries, the wild strong joys</l>
            <l>Of universal Nature, old yet young.</l>
            <l>Such Juan, the third talker, shimmering bright</l>
            <l>As butterfly or bird with quickest life.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The silent ROLDAN has his brightness too,</l>
            <l>But only in his spangles and rosettes.</l>
            <l>His parti-coloured vest and crimson hose</l>
            <l>Are dulled with old Valencian dust, his eyes</l>
            <l>With straining fifty years at gilded balls</l>
            <l>To catch them dancing, or with brazen looks</l>
            <l>At men and women as he made his jests</l>
            <l>Some thousand times and watched to count the</l>
            <l>pence</l>
            <l>His wife was gathering. His olive face</l>
            <l>Has an old writing in it, characters</l>
            <l>Stamped deep by grins that had no merriment,</l>
            <l>The soul's rude mark proclaiming all its blank;</l>
            <l>As on some faces that have long grown old</l>
            <l>In lifting tapers up to forms obscene</l>
            <l>On ancient walls and chuckling with false zest</l>
            <l>To please my lord, who gives the larger fee</l>
            <l>For that hard industry in apishness.</l>
            <l>Roldan would gladly never laugh again;</l>
            <l>Pensioned, he would be grave as any ox,</l>
            <l>And having beans and crumbs and oil secured</l>
            <l>Would borrow no man's jokes for evermore.</l>
            <l>'Tis harder now because his wife is gone,</l>
            <l>Who had quick feet, and danced to ravishment</l>
            <l>Of every ring jewelled with Spanish eyes,</l>
            <l>But died and left this boy, lame from his birth,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And sad and obstinate, though when he will </l>
            <l>He sings God-taught such marrow-thrilling strains </l>
            <l>As seem the very voice of dying Spring, </l>
            <l>A flute-like wail that mourns the blossoms gone, </l>
            <l>And sinks, and is not, like their fragrant breath, </l>
            <l>With fine transition on the trembling air. </l>
            <l>He sits as if imprisoned by some fear, </l>
            <l>Motionless, with wide eyes that seem not made </l>
            <l>For hungry glancing of a twelve-year'd boy </l>
            <l>To mark the living thing that he could teaze, </l>
            <l>But for the gaze of some primeval sadness </l>
            <l>Dark twin with light in the creative ray. </l>
            <l>This little PABLO has his spangles too, </l>
            <l>And large rosettes to hide his poor left foot </l>
            <l>Rounded like any hoof (his mother thought </l>
            <l>God willed it so to punish all her sins). </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I said the souls were five-besides the dog. </l>
            <l>But there was still a sixth, with wrinkled face, </l>
            <l>Grave and disgusted with all merriment </l>
            <l>Not less than Roldan. It is ANNIBAL </l>
            <l>The experienced monkey who performs the tricks, </l>
            <l>Jumps through the hoops, and carries round the hat. </l>
            <l>Once full of sallies and impromptu feats, </l>
            <l>Now cautious not to light on aught that's new, </l>
            <l>Lest he be whipped to do it o'er again </l>
            <l>From A to Z, and make the gentry laugh: </l>
            <l>A misanthropic monkey, grey and grim, </l>
            <l>Bearing a lot that has no remedy </l>
            <l>For want of concert in the monkey tribe. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We see the company, above their heads </l>
            <l>The braided matting, golden as ripe corn, </l>
            <l>Stretched in a curving strip close by the grapes, </l>
            <l>Elsewhere rolled back to greet the cooler sky; </l>
            <l>A fountain near, vase-shapen and broad-lipped, </l>
            <l>Where timorous birds alight with tiny feet, </l>
            <l>And hesitate and bend wise listening ears, </l>
            <l>And fly away again with undipped beak. </l>
            <l>On the stone floor the juggler's heaped-up goods, </l>
            <l>Carpet and hoops, viol and tambourine, </l>
            <l>Where Annibal sits perched with brows severe, </l>
            <l>A serious ape whom none take seriously, </l>
            <l>Obliged in this fool's world to earn his nuts </l>
            <l>By hard buffoonery. We see them all, </l>
            <l>And hear their talk-the talk of Spanish men, </l>
            <l>With Southern intonation, vowels turned </l>
            <l>Caressingly between the consonants, </l>
            <l>Persuasive, willing, with such intervals </l>
            <l>As music borrows from the wooing birds, </l>
            <l>That plead with subtly curving, sweet descentAnd </l>
            <l>yet can quarrel, as these Spaniards can. </l>
          </lg>

            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker> (near the doorway).</l>
            <l>You hear the trumpet? There's old Ramon's blast.</l>
            <l>No bray but his can shake the air so well.</l>
            <l>He takes his trumpeting as solemnly</l>
            <l>As angel charged to wake the dead; thinks war</l>
            <l>Was made for trumpeters, and their great art</l>
            <l>Made solely for themselves who understand it.</l>
            <l>His features all have shaped themselves to blowing,</l>
            <l>And when his trumpet's bagged or left at home</l>
            <l>He seems a chattel in a broker's booth,</l>
            <l>A spoutless watering-can, a promise to pay</l>
            <l>No sum particular. O fine old Ramon!</l>
            <l>The blasts get louder and the clattering hoofs;</l>
            <l>They crack the ear as well as heaven's thunder</l>
            <l>For owls that listen blinking. There's the banner.</l>

            <l>We shall hear news. They say he means a sally-</l>
            <l>Wouldstrike El Zagal's Moors as they push home</l>
            <l>Like ants with booty heavier than themselves;</l>
            <l>Then, joined by other nobles with their bands,</l>
            <l>Lay siege to Guadix. Juan, you're a bird</l>
            <l>That nest within the Castle. What say you?</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nought, I say nought. 'Tis but a toilsome game </l>
            <l>To bet upon that feather Policy, </l>
            <l>And guess where after twice a hundred puffs </l>
            <l>'Twill catch another feather crossing it : </l>
            <l>Guess how the Pope will blow and how the king; </l>
            <l>What force my lady's fan has; how a cough </l>
            <l>Seizing the Padre's throat may raise a gust, </l>
            <l>And how the queen may sigh the feather down. </l>
            <l>Such catching at imaginary threads, </l>
            <l>Such spinning twisted air, is not for me. </l>
            <l>If I should want a game, I'll rather bet </l>
            <l>On racing snails, two large, slow, lingering snails-</l>
            <l>No spurring, equal weights-a chance sublime, </l>
            <l>Nothing to guess at, pure uncertainty. </l>
            <l>Here comes the Duke. They give but feeble shouts. </l>
            <l>And some look sour. </l>

            <l>That gives much favour, but beseeches none.  </l>
            <l>His smile is sweetened by his gravity: </l>
            <l>It comes like dawn upon Sierra snows, </l>
            <l>Seeming more generous for the coldness gone; </l>
            <l>Breaks from the calm-a sudden opening flower </l>
            <l>On dark deep waters : now a chalice shut, </l>
            <l>A mystic shrine, the next a full-rayed star, </l>
            <l>Thrilling, pulse-quickening as a living wor </l>
            <l>I'll make a song of that. </l>

            <l>A duke should know good gold and silver plate; </l>

            <l>The demons fly so thick from sound of bells </l>
            <l>And smell of incense, you may see the air </l>
            <l>Streaked with them as with smoke. Why, they are </l>
            <l>spirits: </l>
            <l>You may well think how crowded they must be </l>
            <l>To make a sort of haze. </l>

            <l>Still, they're of smoky nature, demons are; </l>
            <l>And since you say so-well, it proves the more </l>
            <l>The need of bells and censers. Ay, your Duke</l>
            <l>Sat well : a true hidalgo. I can judge-</l>
            <l>Of harness specially. I saw the camp,</l>
            <l>The royal camp at Velez Malaga.</l>
            <l>'Twas like the court of heaven-such liveries !</l>
            <l>And torches carried by the score at night</l>
            <l>Before the nobles. Sirs, I made a dish</l>
            <l>To set an emerald in would fit a crown,</l>
            <l>For Don Alonzo, lord of Aguilar.</l>
            <l>Your Duke's no whit behind him in his mien</l>
            <l>Or harness either. But you seem to say</l>
            <l>The people love him not.</l>

            <l>Though, as to Abraham and Ishmael,</l>
            <l>I'm an old Christian, and owe nought to them</l>
            <l>Or any Jew among them. But I know</l>
            <l>We made a stir in Saragossa-we :</l>
            <l>The men of Aragon ring hard-true metal</l>
            <l>Sirs, I'm no friend to heresy, but then</l>
            <l>A Christian's money is not safe. As how?</l>
            <l>A lapsing Jew or any heretic</l>
            <l>:May owe me twenty ounces: suddenly</l>
            <l>He's prisoned, suffers penalties-'tis well:</l>
            <l>If men will not believe, 'tis good to make them,</l>
            <l>But let the penalties fall on them alone.</l>
            <l>The Jew is stripped, his goods are confiscate;Now, where, I pray you, go my twenty ounces? </l>
            <l>God knows, and perhaps the King may, but not I. </l>
            <l>And more, my son may lose his young wife's dower </l>
            <l>Because 'twas promised since her father's soul </l>
            <l>Fell to wrong thinking. How was I to know ? </l>
            <l>I could but use my sense and cross myself. </l>
            <l>Christian is Christian-I give in-but still </l>
            <l>Taxing is taxing, though you call it holy. </l>
            <l>We Saragossans liked not this new tax </l>

            <l>You know my meaning-Master Arbués,</l>
            <l>The grand Inquisitor in Aragon.</l>
            <l>I knew nought-paid no copper towards the deed.</l>
            <l>But I was there, at prayers, within the church.</l>
            <l>How could I help it? Why, the saints were there,</l>
            <l>And looked straight on above the altars. I . . .</l>

          </lg>

            <l>Looked carefully another way.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>BLASCO</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Why, at my beads.</l>
            <l>'Twas after midnight, and the canons all</l>
            <l>Were chanting matins. I was not in church</l>
            <l>To gape and stare. I saw the martyr kneel :</l>
            <l>I never liked the look of him alive--</l>
            <l>He was no martyr then. I thought he made</l>
            <l>An ugly shadow as he crept athwart</l>
            <l>The bands of light, then passed within the gloom</l>
            <l>By the broad pillar. 'Twas in our great Seo,</l>
            <l>At Saragossa. The pillars tower so large</l>
            <l>You cross yourself to see them, lest white Death</l>
            <l>Should hide behind their dark. And so it was.</l>
            <l>I looked away again and told my beads</l>
            <l>Unthinkingly; but still a man has ears;</l>
            <l>And right across the chanting came a sound</l>
            <l>As if a tree had crashed above the roar</l>
            <l>Of some great torrent. So it seemed to me;</l>
            <l>For when you listen long and shut your eyes</l>
            <l>Small sounds get thunderous. He had a shell</l>
            <l>Like any lobster: a good iron suit</l>
            <l>From top to toe beneath the innocent serge.</l>
            <l>That made the tell-tale sound. But then came shrieks.</l>
            <l>The chanting stopped and turned to rushing feet,</l>
            <l>And in the midst lay Master Arbués,</l>
            <l>Felled like an ox. 'Twas wicked butchery.</l>
            <l>Some honest men had hoped it would have scared</l>
            <l>The Inquisition out of Aragon.</l>
            <l>'Twas money thrown away-I would say, crime-</l>
            <l>Clean thrown away.</l>

            <l>That was a pity now.</l>
            <l>Next to a missing thrust, what irks me most</l>
            <l>Is a neat well-aimed stroke that kills your man,</l>
            <l>Yet ends in mischief-as in Aragon.</l>
            <l>It was a lesson to our people here.</l>
            <l>Else there's a monk within our city walls,</l>
            <l>A holy, high-born, stem Dominican,</l>
            <l>They might have made the great mistake to kill.</l>

            <l>Covered from head to foot, the Prior is known </l>
            <l>From all the black herd round. When he uncovers </l>
            <l>And stands white-frocked, with ivory face, his eyes </l>
            <l>Black-gleaming, black his coronal of hair </l>
            <l>Like shredded jasper, he seems less a man </l>
            <l>With struggling aims, than pure incarnate Will, </l>
            <l>Fit to subdue rebellious nations, nay, </l>
            <l>That human flesh he breathes in, charged with passion </l>
            <l>Which quivers in his nostril and his lip, </l>
            <l>But disciplined by long in-dwelling will </l>
            <l>To silent labour in the yoke of law. </l>

            <l>Saints should be dead, according to the Church. </l>
            <l>My mind is this : the Father is so holy </l>

            <l>When Pope and Bishop and all customers </l>
            <l>Order alike. But there be bishops now, </l>
            <l>And were aforetime, who have held it wrong, </l>
            <l>This hurry to convert the Jews. As how ? </l>
            <l>Your Jew pays tribute to the bishop, say. </l>
            <l>That's good, and must please God, to see the Church </l>
            <l>Maintained in ways that ease the Christian's purse. </l>
            <l>Convert the Jew, and where's the tribute, pray? </l>
            <l>He lapses, too : 'tis slippery work, conversion : </l>
            <l>And then the holy taxing carries off </l>
            <l>His money at one sweep. No tribute more ! </l>
            <l>He's penitent or burnt, and there's an end. </l>

            <l>Some say, 'twas letters changed the Duke's intent : </l>
            <l>From Malaga, says Blas. From Rome, says Quintin. </l>
            <l>From spies at Guadix, says Sebastian. </l>
            <l>Some say, 'tis all a pretext-say, the Duke </l>
            <l>Is but a lapdog hanging on a skirt, </l>
            <l>Turning his eyeballs upward like a monk : </l>

          <lg>
            <l>LOPEZ. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>One that some say the Duke does iill to wed. </l>
            <l>One that Lis mother reared-God rest her soul!-</l>
            <l>Duchess Diana-she who died last year.</l>
            <l>A bird picked up away from any nest.</l>
            <l>Her name-the Duchess gave it-is Fedalma.</l>
            <l>No harm in that. But the Duke stoops, they say,</l>
            <l>In wedding her. And that's the simple truth.</l>

          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Thy simple truth is but a false opinion :</l>
            <l>The simple truth of asses who believe</l>
            <l>Their thistle is the very best of food.</l>
            <l>Fie, Lopez, thou a Spaniard with a sword</l>
            <l>Dreamest a Spanish noble ever stoops</l>
            <l>By doing honour to the maid he loves !</l>
            <l>He stoops alone when he dishonours her. </l>
            <l>LOPEZ.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nay, I said nought against her.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Better not.</l>
            <l>Else I would challenge thee to fight with wits,</l>
            <l>And spear thee through and through ere thou couldst</l>
            <l>draw</l>
            <l>The bluntest word. Yes, yes, consult thy spurs :</l>
            <l>Spurs are a sign of knighthood, and should tell thee</l>
            <l>That knightly love is blent with reverence</l>
            <l>As heavenly air is blent with heavenly blue. </l>
            <l>Don Silva's heart beats to a loyal tune: </l>
            <l>He wills no highest-born Castilian dame, </l>
            <l>Betrothed to highest noble, should be held </l>
            <l>More sacred than Fedalma. He enshrines </l>
            <l>Her virgin image for the general awe </l>
            <l>And for his own-will guard her from the world, </l>
            <l>Nay, his profaner self, lest he should lose </l>
            <l>The place of his religion. He looks well. </l>
            <l>Nought can come closer to the poet's strain. </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Or farther from his practice, Juan, eh ? </l>
            <l>If thou'rt a sample ? </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Wrong there, my Lorenzo ! </l>
            <l>Touching Fedalma the poor poet plays </l>
            <l>A finer part even than the noble Duke. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>LOPEZ. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>By making ditties, singing with round mouth </l>
            <l>Likest a crowing cock? Thou meanest that? </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Lopez, take physic, thou art getting ill, </l>
            <l>Growing descriptive; 'tis unnatural. </l>
            <l>I mean, Don Silva's love expects reward, </l>
            <l>Kneels with a heaven to come; but the poor poet </l>
            <l>Worships without reward, nor hopes to find </l>
            <l>A heaven save in his worship. He adores </l>
            <l>The sweetest woman for her sweetness' sake, </l>
            <l>Joys in the love that was not born for him, </l>
            <l>Because 'tis lovingness, as beggars joy, </l>
            <l>Warming their naked limbs on wayside walls, </l>
            <l>To hear a tale of princes and their glory. </l>
            <l>There's a poor poet (poor, I mean, in coin) </l>
            <l>Worships Fedalma with so true a love </l>
            <l>That if her silken robe were changed for rags, </l>
            <l>And she were driven out to stony wilds </l>
            <l>Barefoot, a scorned wanderer, he would kiss </l>
            <l>Her ragged garment's edge, and only ask </l>
            <l>For leave to be her slave. Digest that, friend, </l>
            <l>Or let it lie upon thee as a weight </l>
            <l>To check light thinking of Fedalma.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>LOPEZ. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I? </l>
            <l>I think no harm of her; I thank the saints </l>
            <l>I wear a sword and peddle not in thinking. </l>
            <l>'Tis Father Marcos says she'll not confess </l>
            <l>And loves not holy water; says her blood </l>
            <l>Is infidel; says the Duke's wedding her </l>
            <l>Is union of light with darkness. </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Tush! </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[Now Juan-who by snatches touched his lute </l>
            <l>With soft arpeggio, like a whispered dream </l>
            <l>Of sleeping music, while he spoke of love-</l>
            <l>In jesting anger at the soldier's talk </l>
            <l>Thrummed loud and fast, then faster and more loud, </l>
            <l>Till, as he answered "Tush!'' he struck a chord </l>
            <l>Sudden as whip-crack close by Lopez' ear. </l>
            <l>Mine host and Blasco smiled, the mastiff barked, </l>
            <l>Roldan looked up and Annibal looked down, </l>
            <l>Cautiously neutral in so new a case; </l>
            <l>The boy raised longing, listening eyes that seemed </l>
            <l>An exiled spirit's waiting in strained hope </l>
            <l>Of voices coming from the distant land. </l>
            <l>But Lopez bore the assault like any rock: </l>
            <l>That was not what he drew his sword at-he ! </l>
            <l>He spoke with neck erect.] </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ay, Juan, sing, and jar no more. </l>
            <l>Something brand new. Thou'rt wont to make my ear </l>
            <l>A test of novelties. Hast thou aught fresh ? </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>As fresh as rain-drops. Here's a Cancion </l>
            <l>Springs like a tiny mushroom delicate </l>
            <l>Out of the priest's foul scandal of Fedalma. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[He preluded with querying intervals, </l>
            <l>Rising, then falling just a semitone, </l>
            <l>In minor cadence-sound with poiséd wing </l>
            <l>Hovering and quivering towards the needed fall. </l>
            <l>Then in a voice that shook the willing air </l>
            <l>With masculine vibration sang this song. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Should I long that dark were fair ? </l>
            <l>Say, O song ! </l>
            <l>Lacks my love aught, that I should long ? </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Dark the night, with breath all flow'rs, </l>
            <l>And tender broken voice that fills </l>
            <l>With ravishment the listening hours : </l>
            <l>Whisperings, wooings, </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Liquid ripples and soft ring-dove cooings</l>
            <l>In low-toned rhythm that love's aching stills.</l>
            <l>Dark the night,</l>
            <l>Yet £s she bright,</l>
            <l>For in her dark she bring the mystic star,</l>
            <l>Trembling yet strong, as is the voice of love,</l>
            <l>From some unknown afar.</l>
            <l>O radiant Dark ! O darkly-fostered ray !</l>
            <l>Thou hast a joy too deep for shallow Day.</l>
            <l>While Juan sang, all round the tavern court</l>
            <l>Gathered a constellation of black eyes.</l>
            <l>Fat Lola leaned upon the balcony</l>
            <l>With arms that might have pillowed Hercules</l>
            <l>(Who built, 'tis known, the mightiest Spanish towns);</l>
            <l>Thin Aida's face, sad as a wasted passion,</l>
            <l>Leaned o'er the nodding baby's; 'twixt the rails</l>
            <l>The little Pepe showed his two black beads,</l>
            <l>His flat-ringed hair and small Semitic nose,</l>
            <l>Complete and tiny as a new-born minnow ;</l>
            <l>Patting his head and holding in her arms</l>
            <l>The baby senior, stood Lorenzo's wife</l>
            <l>All negligent, her kerchief discomposed</l>
            <l>By little clutches, woman's coquetry</l>
            <l>Quite turned to mother's cares and sweet content.</l>
            <l>These on the balcony, while at the door</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Gazed the lank boys and lazy-shouldered men.</l>
            <l>'Tis likely too the rats and insects peeped,</l>
            <l>Being southern Spanish ready for a lounge.</l>
            <l>The singer smiled, as doubtless Orpheus smiled,</l>
            <l>To see the animals both great and small,</l>
            <l>The mountainous elephant and scampering mouse,</l>
            <l>Held by the ears in decent audience ;</l>
            <l>Then, when mine host desired the strain once more,</l>
            <l>He fell to preluding with rhythmic change</l>
            <l>Of notes recurrent, soft as pattering drops</l>
            <l>That fall from off the eaves in faëry dance</l>
            <l>When clouds are breaking ; till at measured pause</l>
            <l>He struck with strength, in rare responsive chords.]</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>All's one to me. I note no change of tune,</l>
            <l>Not I, save in the ring of horses' hoofs,</l>
            <l>Or in the drums and trumpets when they call</l>
            <l>To action or retreat. I ne'er could see</l>

            <l>I'd give up the best jugglery in life</l>
            <l>To see a miserable juggler pleased.</l>

            <l>I may be there anon, but first I go</l>
            <l>To the lower prison. There is strict command </l>
            <l>That all our gypsy prisoners shall to-night </l>
            <l>Be lodged within the fort. They've forged enough </l>
            <l>Of balls and bullets-used up all the metal. </l>
            <l>At morn to-morrow they must carry stones </l>
            <l>Up the south tower. 'Tis a fine stalwart band, </l>
            <l>Fit for the hardest tasks. Some say, the queen </l>
            <l>Would have the Gypsies banished with the Jews. </l>
            <l>Some say, 'twere better harness them for work. </l>
            <l>They'd feed on any filth and save the Spaniard. </l>

            <l>Go, sir, with God (_exit Lopez_). A very proper man, </l>
            <l>And soldierly. But, for this banishment </l>
            <l>Some men are hot on, it ill pleases me. </l>
            <l>The Jews, now (sirs, if any Christian here </l>
            <l>Had Jews for ancestors, I blame him not ; </l>
            <l>We cannot all be Goths of Aragon)-</l>
            <l>Jews are not fit for heaven, but on earth </l>
            <l>They are most useful. 'Tis the same with mules, </l>
            <l>Horses, or oxen, or with any pig </l>
            <l>Except Saint Anthony's. They are useful here </l>
            <l>(The Jews, I mean) though they may go to hell. </l>
            <l>And, look you, useful sins-why Providence </l>
            <l>Sends Jews to do 'em, saving Christian souls. </l>
            <l>The very Gypsies, curbed and harnessed well, </l>
            <l>Would make draught cattle, feed on vermin too, </l>
            <l>Cost less than grazing brutes, and tum bad food </l>
            <l>To handsome carcasses ; sweat at the forge </l>
            <l>For little wages, and well drilled and flogged </l>
            <l>Might work like slaves, some Spaniards looking on. </l>
            <l>I deal in plate, and am no priest to say </l>
            <l>What God may mean, save when he means plain </l>
            <l>sense; </l>
            <l>But when he sent the Gypsies wandering </l>
            <l>In punishment because they sheltered not </l>
            <l>Our Lady and Saint Joseph (and no doubt </l>
            <l>Stole the small ass they fled with into Egypt), </l>
            <l>Why send them here? 'Tis plain he saw the use </l>
            <l>They'd be to Spaniards. Shall we banish them, </l>
            <l>And tell God we know better? 'Tis a sin. </l>
            <l>They talk of vermin ; but, sirs, vermin large </l>
            <l>Were made to eat the small, or else to eat </l>
            <l>The noxious rubbish, and picked Gypsy men </l>
            <l>Might serve in war to climb, be killed, and fall </l>
            <l>To make an easy ladder. Once I saw </l>
            <l>A Gypsy sorcerer, at a spring and grasp </l>
            <l>Kill one who came to seize him : talk of strength I </l>
            <l>Nay, swiftness too, for while we crossed ourselves </l>
            <l>He vanished like-say, like . . . </l>

            <l>	Chieftain of a band, </l>
            <l>The Moor's allies, whom full a month ago </l>
            <l>Our Duke surprised and brought as captives home. </l>
            <l>He needed smiths, and doubtless the brave Moor </l>
            <l>Has missed some useful scouts and archers too. </l>
            <l>Juan's fantastic pleasure is to watch </l>
            <l>These Gypsies forging, and to hold discourse </l>
            <l>With this great chief, whom he transforms at will </l>
            <l>To sage or warrior, and like the sun </l>
            <l>Plays daily at fallacious alchemy, </l>
            <l>Turns sand to gold and dewy spider-webs </l>
            <l>To myriad rainbows. Still the sand is sand, </l>
            <l>And still in sober shade you see the web. </l>
            <l>'Tis so, I'll wager, with his Gypsy chief-</l>
            <l>A piece of stalwart cunning, nothing more. </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No! My invention had been all too poor </l>
            <l>To frame this Zarca as I saw him first. </l>
            <l>'Twas when they stripped him. In his chieftain's </l>
            <l>gear, </l>
            <l>Amidst his men he seemed a royal barb </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Followed by wild-maned Andalusian colts.</l>
            <l>He had a necklace of a strange device</l>
            <l>In finest gold of unknown workmanship,</l>
            <l>But delicate as Moorish, fit to kiss</l>
            <l>Fedalma's neck, and play in shadows there.</l>
            <l>He wore fine mail, a rich-wrought sword and belt,</l>
            <l>And on his surcoat black a broidered torch,</l>
            <l>A pine-branch flaming, grasped by two dark hands.</l>
            <l>But when they stripped him of his ornaments</l>
            <l>It was the baubles lost their grace, not he.</l>
            <l>His eyes, his mouth, his nostril, all inspired</l>
            <l>With scorn that mastered utterance of scorn,</l>
            <l>With power to check all rage until it turned</l>
            <l>To ordered force, unleashed on chosen prey-</l>
            <l>It seemed the soul within him made his limbs</l>
            <l>And made them grand. The baubles were well gone.</l>
            <l>He stood the more a king, when bared to man.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Maybe. But nakedness is bad for trade,</l>
            <l>And is not decent. Well-wrought metal, sir,</l>
            <l>Is not a bauble. Had you seen the camp,</l>
            <l>The royal camp at Velez Malaga,</l>
            <l>Ponce de Leon and the other dukes,</l>
            <l>The king himself and all his thousand knights</l>
            <l>For bodyguard, 'twould not have left you breathTo praise a Gypsy thus. A man's a man; </l>
            <l>But when you see a king, you see the work </l>
            <l>Of many thousand men. King Ferdinand </l>
            <l>Bears a fine presence, and hath proper limbs ; </l>
            <l>But what though he were shrunken as a relic? </l>
            <l>You'd see the gold and gems that cased him o'er, </l>
            <l>And all the pages round him in brocade, </l>
            <l>And all the lords, themselves a sort of kings, </l>
            <l>Doing him reverence. That strikes an awe </l>
            <l>Into a common man-especially </l>
            <l>A judge of plate. </l>

            <l>The old rain-fretted mountains in their robes </l>
            <l>Of shadow-broken grey ; the rounded hills </l>
            <l>Reddened with blood of Titans, whose huge limbs, </l>
            <l>Entombed within, feed full the hardy flesh </l>
            <l>Of cactus green and blue broad-sworded aloes; </l>
            <l>The cypress soaring black above the lines </l>
            <l>Of white court-walls ; the jointed sugar-canes </l>
            <l>Pale-golden with their feathers motionless </l>
            <l>In the warm quiet :-all thought-teaching form</l>
            <l>Utters itself in firm unshimmering hues. </l>
            <l>For the great rock has screened the westering sun </l>
            <l>That still on plains beyond streams vaporous gold </l>
            <l>Among the branches ; and within Bedmár </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Has come the time of sweet serenity</l>
            <l>When colour glows unglittering, and the soul</l>
            <l>Of visible things shows silent happiness,</l>
            <l>As that of lovers trusting though apart.</l>
            <l>The ripe-cheeked fruits, the crimson-petalled flowers ;</l>
            <l>The wingéd life that pausing seems a gem</l>
            <l>Cunningly carven on the dark green leaf;</l>
            <l>The face of man with hues supremely blent</l>
            <l>To difference fine as of a voice 'mid sounds:-</l>
            <l>Each lovely· light-dipped thing seems to emerge</l>
            <l>Flushed gravely from baptismal sacrament.</l>
            <l>All beauteous existence rests, yet wakes,</l>
            <l>Lies still, yet conscious, with clear open eyes</l>
            <l>And gentle breath and mild suffused joy.</l>
            <l>'Tis day, but day that falls like melody</l>
            <l>Repeated on a string with graver tones-</l>
            <l>Tones such as linger in a long farewelL</l>
            <l>The Plaça widens in the passive airThe</l>
            <l>Plaça Santiago, where the church,</l>
            <l>A mosque converted, shows an eyeless face</l>
            <l>Red-checkered, faded, doing penauce still-</l>
            <l>Bearing with Moorish arch the imaged saint,</l>
            <l>Apostle, baron, Spanish warrior,</l>
            <l>Whose charger's hoofs trample the turbaned dead,</l>
            <l>Whose banner with the Cross, the bloody sword</l>
            <l>Flashes athwart the Moslem's glazing eye, </l>
            <l>And mocks his trust in Allah who forsakes. </l>
            <l>Up to the church the Plaça gently slopes, </l>
            <l>In shape most like the pious palmer's shell, </l>
            <l>Girdled with low white houses ; high above </l>
            <l>Tower the strong fortress and sharp-angled wall </l>
            <l>And well-flanked castle gate. From o'er the roofs, </l>
            <l>And from the shadowed pátios cool, there spreads </l>
            <l>The breath of flowers and aromatic leaves </l>
            <l>Soothing the sense with bliss indefinite-</l>
            <l>A baseless hope, a glad presentiment, </l>
            <l>That curves the lip more softly, fills the eye </l>
            <l>With more indulgent beam. .And so it soothes, </l>
            <l>So gently sways the pulses of the crowd </l>
            <l>Who make a zone about the central spot </l>
            <l>Chosen by Roldan for his theatre. </l>
            <l>Maids with arched eyebrows, delicate -pencilled, </l>
            <l>dark, </l>
            <l>Fold their round arms below the kerchief full ; </l>
            <l>Men shoulder little girls ; and grandames grey, </l>
            <l>But muscular still, hold babies on their arms ; </l>
            <l>While mothers keep the stout-legged boys in front </l>
            <l>Against their skirts, as old Greek pictures show </l>
            <l>The Glorious Mother with the Boy divine. </l>
            <l>Youths keep the places for themselves, and roll </l>
            <l>Large lazy eyes, and call recumbent dogs </l>
            <l>(For reasons deep below the reach of thought). </l>
            <l>The old men cough with purpose, wish to hint </l>
            <l>Wisdom within that cheapens jugglery, </l>
            <l>Maintain a neutral air, and knit their brows </l>
            <l>In observation. None are quarrelsome, </l>
            <l>Noisy, or very merry; for their blood </l>
            <l>Moves slowly into fervour-they rejoice </l>
            <l>Like those dark birds that sweep with heavy wing, </l>
            <l>Cheering their mates with melancholy cries. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But now the gilded balls begin to play </l>
            <l>In rhythmic numbers, ruled by practice fine </l>
            <l>Of eye and muscle: all the juggler's form</l>
            <l>Consents harmonious in swift-gliding change, </l>
            <l>Easily forward stretched or backward bent </l>
            <l>With lightest step and movement circular </l>
            <l>Round a fixed point : 'tis not the old Roldan now, </l>
            <l>The dull, hard, weary, miserable man, </l>
            <l>The soul all parched to languid appetite </l>
            <l>And memory of desire : 'tis wondrous force </l>
            <l>That moves in combination multiform </l>
            <l>Towards conscious ends : 'tis Roldan glorious, </l>
            <l>Holding all eyes like any meteor, </l>
            <l>King of the moment save when Annibal </l>
            <l>Divides the scene and plays the comic part, </l>
            <l>Gazing with blinking glances up and down </l>
            <l>Dancing and throwing nought and catching it, </l>
            <l>With mimicry as merry as the tasks </l>
            <l>Of penance-working shades in Tartarus. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Pablo stands passive, and a space apart, </l>
            <l>Holding a viol, waiting for command. </l>
            <l>Music must not be wasted, but must rise </l>
            <l>As needed climax ; and the audience </l>
            <l>Is growing with late comers. Juan now, </l>
            <l>And the familiar Host, with Blasco broad, </l>
            <l>Find way made gladly to the inmost round </l>
            <l>Studded with heads. Lorenzo knits the crowd </l>
            <l>Into one family by showing all </l>
            <l>Good-will and recognition. Juan casts </l>
            <l>His large and rapid-measuring glance around; </l>
            <l>But-with faint quivering, transient as a breath </l>
            <l>Shaking a flame-his eyes make sudden pause </l>
            <l>Where by the jutting angle of a street </l>
            <l>Castle-ward leading, stands a female form, </l>
            <l>A kerchief pale square-drooping o'er the brow, </l>
            <l>About her shoulders dim brown serge-in garb </l>
            <l>Most like a peasant woman from the vale, </l>
            <l>Who might have lingered after marketing </l>
            <l>To see the show. What thrill mysterious, </l>
            <l>Ray-borne from orb to orb of conscious eyes, </l>
            <l>The swift observing sweep of Juan's glance </l>
            <l>Arrests an instant, then with prompting fresh</l>
            <l>Diverts it lastingly? He turns at once</l>
            <l>To watch the gilded balls, and nod and smile</l>
            <l>At little round Pepíta, blondest maid</l>
            <l>In all Bedmar-Pepíta, fair yet flecked,</l>
            <l>Saucy of lip and nose, of hair as red</l>
            <l>As breasts of robins stepping on the snow-</l>
            <l>Who stands in front with little tapping feet,</l>
            <l>And baby-dimpled hands that hide enclosed</l>
            <l>Those sleeping crickets, the dark castanets.</l>
            <l>But soon the gilded balls have ceased to play</l>
            <l>And Annibal is leaping through the hoops,</l>
            <l>That turn to twelve, meeting him as he flies</l>
            <l>In the swift circle. Shuddering he leaps,</l>
            <l>But with each spring flies swift and swifter still</l>
            <l>To loud and louder shouts, while the great hoops</l>
            <l>Are changed to .smaller. Now the crowd is fired.</l>
            <l>The motion swift, the living victim urged,</l>
            <l>The imminent failure and repeated scape</l>
            <l>Hurry all pulses and intoxicate</l>
            <l>With subtle wine of passion many-mixt.</l>
            <l>'Tis all about a monkey leaping hard</l>
            <l>Till near to gasping ; but it serves as well</l>
            <l>As the great circus or arena dire,</l>
            <l>Where these are lacking. Roldan cautiously</l>
            <l>Slackens the leaps and lays the hoops to rest,</l>
            <l>And Annibal retires with reeling brain</l>
            <l>And backward stagger-pity, he could not smile!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Now Roldan spreads his carpet, now he shows</l>
            <l>Strange metamorphoses: the pebble black</l>
            <l>Changes to whitest egg within his hand;</l>
            <l>A staring rabbit, with retreating ears,</l>
            <l>Is swallowed by the air and vanishes ;</l>
            <l>He tells men's thoughts about the shaken dice,</l>
            <l>Their secret choosings; makes the white beans pass</l>
            <l>With causeless act sublime from cup to cup</l>
            <l>Turned empty on the ground-diablerie</l>
            <l>That pales the girls and puzzles all the boys :</l>
            <l>These tricks are samples, hinting to the town</l>
            <l>Roldan's great mastery. He tumbles next,</l>
            <l>And Annibal is called to mock each feat</l>
            <l>With arduous comicality and save</l>
            <l>By rule romantic the great public mind</l>
            <l>(And Roldan's body) from too serious strain.</l>
            <l>But with the tumbling, lest the feats should fail,</l>
            <l>And so need veiling in a haze of sound,</l>
            <l>Pablo awakes the viol and the bow-</l>
            <l>The masculine bow that draws the woman's heart</l>
            <l>From out the strings and makes them cry, yearn,</l>
            <l>plead,</l>
            <l>Tremble, exult, with mystic union </l>
            <l>Of joy acute and tender suffering. </l>
            <l>To play the viol and discreetly mix </l>
            <l>Alternate with the how's keen biting tones </l>
            <l>The throb responsive to the finger's touch, </l>
            <l>Was rarest skill that Pablo half had caught </l>
            <l>From an old blind and wandering Catalan ; </l>
            <l>The other half was rather heritage </l>
            <l>From treasure stored by generations past </l>
            <l>In winding chambers of receptive sense. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The wingéd sounds exalt the thick-pressed crowd </l>
            <l>With a new pulse in common, blending all </l>
            <l>The gazing life in to one larger soul </l>
            <l>With dimly widened consciousness: as waves </l>
            <l>In heightened movement tell of waves far off. </l>
            <l>And the light changes ; westward stationed clouds, </l>
            <l>The sun's ranged outposts, luminous message spread, </l>
            <l>Rousing quiescent things to doff their shade </l>
            <l>And show themselves as added audience. </l>
            <l>Now Pablo, letting fall the eager bow, </l>
            <l>Solicits softer murmurs from the strings, </l>
            <l>And now above them pours a wondrous voice </l>
            <l>(Such as Greek reapers heard in Sicily) </l>
            <l>With wounding rapture in it, like love's arrows; </l>
            <l>And clear upon clear air as coloured gems </l>
            <l>Dropped in a crystal cup of water pure, </l>
            <l>Fall words of sadness, simple, lyrical : </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>_Spring comes hither, </l>
            <l>Buds the rose; </l>
            <l>Roses wither, </l>
            <l>Sweet spring goes. </l>
            <l>Ojalà, would she carry me! </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Summer soars-</l>
            <l>Wide-winged day </l>
            <l>White light pours, </l>
            <l>Flies away. </l>
            <l>Ojalà, would he carry me! </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Soft winds blow, </l>
            <l>Westward born, </l>
            <l>Onward go </l>
            <l>Toward the morn. </l>
            <l>Ojalà, would they carry me! </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Sweet birds sing </l>
            <l>O'er the graves, </l>
            <l>Then take wing </l>
            <l>O'er the waves. </l>
            <l>Ojalà, would they carry me!_</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>When the voice paused and left the viol's note</l>
            <l>To plead forsaken, 'twas as when a cloud</l>
            <l>Hiding the sun, makes all the leaves and flowers</l>
            <l>Shiver. But when with measured change the strings</l>
            <l>Had taught regret new longing, clear again,</l>
            <l>Welcome as hope recovered, flowed the voice.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>_Warm whispering through the slender olive leaves</l>
            <l>Came to me a gentle sound,</l>
            <l>Whispering of a secret found</l>
            <l>In the clear sunshine 'mid the golden sheaves:</l>
            <l>Said it was sleeping for me in the morn,</l>
            <l>Called it gladness, called it joy,</l>
            <l>Drew me on-" Come hither, boy"-</l>
            <l>To where the blue wings rested on the corn.</l>
            <l>I thought the gentle sound had whispered true-</l>
            <l>Thought the little heaven mine,</l>
            <l>Leaned to clutch the thing divine,</l>
            <l>And saw the blue wings melt within the blue._</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The long notes linger on the trembling air,</l>
            <l>With subtle penetration enter all</l>
            <l>The myriad corridors of the passionate soul,</l>
            <l>Message-like spread, and answering action rouse.</l>
            <l>Not angular jigs that warm the chilly limbs</l>
            <l>In hoary northern mists, but action curved</l>
            <l>To soft andante strains pitched plaintively.</l>
            <l>Vibrations sympathetic stir all limbs :</l>
            <l>Old men live backward in their dancing prime,</l>
            <l>And move in memory ; small legs and arms</l>
            <l>With pleasant agitation purposeless</l>
            <l>Go up and down like pretty fruits in gales.</l>
            <l>All long in common for the expressive act</l>
            <l>Yet wait for it ; as in the olden time</l>
            <l>Men waited for the bard to tell their thought.</l>
            <l>"The dance ! the dance !" is shouted all around.</l>
            <l>Now Pablo lifts the bow, Pepíta now,</l>
            <l>Ready as bird that sees the sprinkled corn,</l>
            <l>When Juan nods and smiles, puts forth her foot</l>
            <l>And lifts her arm to wake the castanets.</l>
            <l>Juan advances, too, from out the ring</l>
            <l>And bends to quit his lute ; for now the scene</l>
            <l>Is empty; Roldan weary, gathers pence,</l>
            <l>Followed by Annibal with purse and stick.</l>
            <l>The carpet lies a coloured isle untrod,</l>
            <l>Inviting feet: "The dance, the dance," resounds,</l>
            <l>The bow entreats with slow melodic strain,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And all the air with expectation yearns.</l>
            <l>Sudden, with gliding motion like a flame</l>
            <l>That through dim vapour makes a path of glory,</l>
            <l>A figure lithe, all white and saffron-robed,</l>
            <l>Flashed right across the circle, and now stood </l>
            <l>With ripened arms uplift and regal head, </l>
            <l>Like some tall flower whose dark and intense heart </l>
            <l>Lieis half within a tulip-tinted cup. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Juan stood fixed and pale ; Pepíta stepped </l>
            <l>Backward within the ring : the voices fell </l>
            <l>From shouts insistent to more passive tones </l>
            <l>Half meaning welcome, half astonishment. </l>
            <l>"Lady Fedalma!-will she dance for us?" </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But she, sole swayed by impulse passionate, </l>
            <l>Feeling all life was music and all eyes </l>
            <l>The warming quickening light that music makes, </l>
            <l>Moved as, in dance religious, Miriam, </l>
            <l>When on the Red Sea shore she raised her voice </l>
            <l>And led the chorus of the people's joy; </l>
            <l>Or as the Trojan maids that reverent sang </l>
            <l>Watching the sorrow-crowned Hecuba: </l>
            <l>Moved in slow curves voluminous, gradual, </l>
            <l>Feeling and action flowing into one, </l>
            <l>In Eden's natural taintless marriage-bond; </l>
            <l>Ardently modest, sensuously pure, </l>
            <l>With young delight that wonders at itself </l>
            <l>And throbs as innocent as opening flowers, </l>
            <l>Knowing not comment-soilless, beautiful. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The spirit in her gravely glowing face </l>
            <l>With sweet community informs her limbs, </l>
            <l>Filling their fine gradation with the breath </l>
            <l>Of virgin majesty ; as full vowelled words </l>
            <l>Are new impregnate with the master's thought. </l>
            <l>Even the chance-strayed delicate tendrils black, </l>
            <l>That backward 'scape from out her wreathing hair-</l>
            <l>Even the pliant folds that cling transverse </l>
            <l>When with obliquely soaring bend altern </l>
            <l>She seems a goddess quitting earth again-</l>

            <l>And resonance exquisite from the grand chord </l>
            <l>Of her harmoniously bodied soul. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>At first a reverential silence guards </l>
            <l>The eager senses of the gazing crowd : </l>
            <l>They hold their breath, and live by seeing her. </l>
            <l>But soon the admiring tension finds reliefSighs </l>
            <l>of delight, applausive murmurs low, </l>
            <l>And stirrings gentle as of earéd corn </l>
            <l>Or seed-bent grasses, when the ocean's breath </l>
            <l>Spreads landward. Even Juan is impelled </l>
            <l>By the swift-travelling movement: fear and doubt </l>
            <l>Give way before the hurrying energy ; </l>
            <l>He takes his lute and strikes in fellowship, </l>
            <l>Filling more full the rill of melody </l>
          </lg>

            <l>Raised ever and a.non to clearest flood </l>
            <l>By Pablo's voice, that dies away too soon, </l>
            <l>Like the sweet blackbird's fragmentary chant, </l>
            <l>Yet wakes again, with varying rise and fall; </l>
            <l>In songs that seem emergent memories </l>
            <l>Prompting brief utterance-little cancións </l>
            <l>And villancicos, Andalusia-born. </l>

            <l>It was in the prime </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Of the sweet Spring-time. </l>
            <l>In the linnet's throat </l>
            <l>Trembled the love-note, </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And the love-stirred air </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Thrilled the blossoms there. </l>
            <l>Little shadows danced </l>
            <l>Each a tiny elf, </l>
            <l>Happy in large light </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And the thinnest self. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It was but a minute </l>
            <l>In a far-off Spring, </l>
            <l>But each gentle thing, </l>

          <lg>
            <l>Sweetly-wooing linnet, </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>.And still the light is changing : high above </l>
            <l>Float soft pink clouds; others with deeper flush </l>
            <l>Stretch like flamingos bending toward the south. </l>
            <l>Comes a more solemn brilliance o'er the sky, </l>
            <l>A meaning more intense upon the air-</l>
            <l>The inspiration of the dying day. </l>
            <l>And Juan now, when Pablo's notes subside, </l>
            <l>Soothes the regretful ear, and breaks the pause </l>
            <l>With masculine voice in deep antiphony. </l>

            <l>Day is dying I Float, O song, </l>
            <l>Down the westward river, </l>
            <l>Requiem chanting to the DayDay, </l>
            <l>the mighty Giver. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Pierced by shaftes of Time he bleeds, </l>
            <l>Melted rubies sending </l>
            <l>Through the river and the sky, </l>
            <l>Earth and heaven blending ; </l>

            <l>And widening circle ; now she seems to glow </l>
            <l>With more declared presence, glorified. </l>
            <l>Circling, she lightly bends and lifts on high </l>
            <l>The multitudinous-sounding tambourine, </l>
            <l>And makes it ring and boom, then lifts it higher </l>
            <l>Stretching her left arm beauteous ; now the crowd </l>
            <l>Exultant shouts, forgetting poverty </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>In the rich moment of possessing her. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But sudden, at one point, the exultant throng </l>
            <l>Is pushed and hustled, and then thrust apart : </l>
            <l>Something approaches-something cuts the ring </l>
            <l>Of jubilant idlers-startling as a streak </l>
            <l>From alien wounds across the blooming flesh </l>
            <l>Of careless sporting childhood. 'Tis the band </l>
            <l>Of Gypsy prisoners. Soldiers lead the van </l>
            <l>And make sparse flanking guard, aloof surveyed </l>
            <l>By gallant Lopez, stringent in command. </l>
            <l>The Gypsies chained in couples, all save one, </l>
            <l>Walk in dark file with grand bare legs and arms </l>
            <l>And savage melancholy in their eyes </l>
            <l>That star-like gleam from out black clouds of hair; </l>
            <l>Now they are full in sight, and now they stretch </l>
            <l>Right to the centre of the open space. </l>
            <l>Fedalma now, with gentle wheeling sweep </l>
            <l>Returning, like the loveliest of the Hours </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Strayed from her sisters, truant lingering, </l>
            <l>Faces again the centre, swings again </l>
            <l>The uplifted tambourine. . . . </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>When lo ! with sound </l>
            <l>Stupendous throbbing, solemn as a voice </l>
            <l>Sent by the invisible choir of all the dead, </l>
            <l>Tolls the great passing bell that calls to prayer </l>
            <l>For souls departed: at the mighty beat </l>
            <l>It seems the light sinks awe-struck-'tis the note </l>
            <l>Of the sun's burial ; speech and action pause ; </l>
            <l>Religious silence and the holy sign </l>
            <l>Of everlasting memories (the sign </l>
            <l>Of death that turned to more diffusive life) </l>
            <l>Pass o'er the Plaça. Little children gaze </l>
            <l>\Vith lips apart, and feel the unknown god ; </l>
            <l>And the most men and women pray. Not all. </l>
            <l>The soldiers pray ; the Gypsies stand unmoved </l>
            <l>As pagan statues with proud level gaze. </l>
            <l>But he who wears a solitary chain </l>
            <l>Heading the file, has turned to face Fedalma. </l>
            <l>She motionless, with arm uplifted, guards </l>
            <l>The tambourine aloft (lest, sudden-lowered, </l>
            <l>Its trivial jingle mar the duteous pause), </l>
            <l>Reveres the general prayer, but prays not, stands </l>
            <l>With level glance meeting that Gypsy's eyes, </l>
            <l>That seem to her the sadness of the world </l>
            <l>Rebuking her, the great bell's hidden thought </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Now first unveiled-the sorrows unredeemed </l>
            <l>Of races outcast, scorned, and wandering. </l>
            <l>Why does he look at her ? why she at him? </l>
            <l>As if the meeting light between their eyes </l>
            <l>Made permanent union? His deep-knit brow, </l>
            <l>Inflated nostril, scornful lip compressed, </l>
            <l>Seem a dark hieroglyph of coming fate </l>
            <l>Written before her. Father Isidor </l>
            <l>Had terrible eyes and was her enemy ; </l>
            <l>She knew it and defied him ; all her soul </l>
            <l>Rounded and hardened in its separateness </l>
            <l>When they encountered. But this prisonerThis </l>
            <l>Gypsy, passing, gazing casually-</l>
            <l>Was he her enemy too ? She stood all quelled, </l>
            <l>The impetuous joy that hurried in her veins </l>
            <l>Seemed backward rushing turned to chillest awe, </l>
            <l>Uneasy wonder, and a vague self-doubt. </l>
            <l>The minute brief stretched measureless, dream-filled </l>
            <l>By a dilated new-fraught consciousness. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Now it was gone; the pious murmur ceased, </l>
            <l>The Gypsies all moved onward at command </l>
            <l>And careless noises blent confusedly. </l>
            <l>But the ring closed again, and many ears </l>
            <l>Waited for Pablo's music, many eyes </l>
            <l>Turned towards the carpet : it lay bare and dim, </l>
            <l>Twilight was there-the bright Fedalma gone. </l>

            <l>And perilous heightening of the sentient soul. </l>
            <l>But look less curiously : life itself </l>
            <l>May not express us all, may leave the worst </l>
            <l>And the best too, like tunes in mechanism </l>
            <l>Never awaked. In various catalogues </l>
            <l>Objects stand variously. Silva stands </l>
            <l>As a young Spaniard, handsome, noble, brave, </l>
            <l>With titles many, high in pedigree ; </l>
            <l>Or, as a nature quiveringly poised </l>
            <l>In reach of storms, whose qualities may turn </l>
            <l>To murdered virtues that still walk as ghosts </l>
            <l>Within the shuddering soul and shriek remorse ; </l>
            <l>Or, as a lover . . . . In the screening time </l>
            <l>Of purple blossoms, when the petals crowd </l>
            <l>And softly crush like cherub cheeks in heaven, </l>
            <l>Who thinks of greenly withered fruit and worms? </l>
            <l>O the warm southern spring is beauteous ! </l>
            <l>And in love's spring all good seems possible : </l>
            <l>No threats, all promise, brooklets ripple full </l>
            <l>And bathe the rushes, vicious crawling things </l>
            <l>Are pretty eggs, the sun shines graciously </l>
            <l>And parches not, the silent rain beats warm </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>As childhood's kisses, days are young and grow, </l>
            <l>And earth seems in its sweet beginning time </l>
            <l>Fresh made for two who live in Paradise. </l>

            <l>As in a garden fenced in for delight,And </l>
            <l>he may seek delight. Smiling he lifts </l>
            <l>A whistle from his belt, but lets it fall </l>
            <l>Ere it has reached his lips, jarred by the sound </l>

            <l>Toppling in fragments meaningless. What is—</l>
            <l>What will be—must be—pooh! they wait the key </l>
            <l>Of that which is not yet; all other keys</l>
            <l>Are made of our conjectures, take their sense </l>
            <l>From humours fooled by hope, or by despair. </l>
            <l>Know what is good? O God, we know not yet </l>
            <l>If bliss itself is not young misery</l>
            <l>With fangs swift growing. . . .</l>
            <l>But some outward harm</l>
            <l>May even now be hurting, grieving her.</l>
            <l>Oh! I must search—face shame—if shame be there. </l>
            <l>Here, Perez! hasten to Don Alvar—tell him</l>
            <l>Lady Fedalma must be sought—is lost—</l>
            <l>Has met, I fear, some mischance. He must send </l>
            <l>Towards divers points. I go myself to seek </l>
            <l>First in the town. . . .</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[As Perez oped the door, </l>
            <l>Then moved aside for passage of the Duke, </l>
            <l>Fedalma entered, cast away the cloud</l>
            <l>Of serge and linen, and outbeaming bright, </l>
            <l>Advanced a pace towards Silva—but then paused, </l>
            <l>For he had started and retreated; she,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Quick and responsive as the subtle air</l>
            <l>To change in him, divined that she must wait </l>
            <l>Until they were alone: they stood and looked. </l>
            <l>Within the Duke was struggling confluence</l>
            <l>Of feelings manifold—pride, anger, dread, </l>
            <l>Meeting in stormy rush with sense secure</l>
            <l>That she was present, with the new-stilled thirst </l>
            <l>Of gazing love, with trust inevitable</l>
            <l>As in beneficent virtues of the light</l>
            <l>And all earth's sweetness, that Fedalma's soul </l>
            <l>Was free from blemishing purpose. Yet proud </l>
            <l>wrath</l>
            <l>Leaped in dark flood above the purer stream </l>
            <l>That strove to drown it: Anger seeks its prey—</l>
            <l>Something to tear with sharp-edged tooth and claw, </l>
            <l>Likes not to go off hungry, leaving Love</l>
            <l>To feast on milk and honeycomb at will. </l>
            <l>Silva's heart said, he must be happy soon, </l>
            <l>She being there; but to be happy—first</l>
            <l>He must be angry, having cause. Yet love </l>
            <l>Shot like a stifled cry of tenderness</l>
            <l>All through the harshness he would fain have given </l>
            <l>To the dear word,]</l>

            <l>O my lord!</l>
            <l>You are come back, and I was wandering!</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh no,</l>

          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
            <l>Then my known wish</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>That depends</l>
            <l>On what the wish may be. You wished me once </l>
            <l>Not to uncage the birds. I meant to obey:</l>
            <l>But in a moment something—something stronger, </l>
            <l>Forced me to let them out. It did no harm.</l>
            <l>They all came back again—the silly birds!</l>
            <l>I told you, after.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.(with haughty coldness).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Will you tell me now</l>
            <l>What was the prompting stronger than my wish </l>
            <l>That made you wander?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (advancing a step towards him, with a sudden look of anxiety). </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>

            <l>A man deep-wounded may feel too much pain </l>

            <l>Yes!</l>
            <l>Have I not made your place and dignity </l>
            <l>The very heart of my ambition? You— </l>
            <l>No enemy could do it—you alone</l>
            <l>Can strike it mortally.</l>

            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.	</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nay, Silva, nay.</l>
            <l>Has some one told you false? I only went</l>
            <l>To see the world with Iñez—see the town, </l>
            <l>The people, everything. It was no harm. </l>
            <l>I did not mean to dance: it happened so </l>
            <l>At last . . .</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O God, it's true then!—true that you, </l>
            <l>A maiden nurtured as rare flowers are,</l>
            <l>The very air of heaven sifted fine</l>
            <l>Lest any mote should mar your purity, </l>
            <l>Have flung yourself out on the dusty way </l>
            <l>For common eyes to see your beauty soiled!</l>
            <l>You own it true—you danced upon the Placa?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (proudly).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, it is true. I was not wrong to dance. </l>
            <l>The air was filled with music, with a song</l>
            <l>That seemed the voice of the sweet eventide— </l>
            <l>The glowing light entering through eye and ear—</l>
            <l>That seemed our love—mine, yours—they are but one—</l>
            <l>Trembling through all my limbs, as fervent words </l>
            <l>Tremble within my soul and must be spoken.</l>
            <l>And all the people felt a common joy</l>
            <l>And shouted for the dance. A brightness soft </l>
            <l>As of the angels moving down to see </l>
            <l>Illuminated the broad space. The joy, the life</l>
            <l>Around, within me, were one heaven: I longed </l>
            <l>To blend them visibly: I longed to dance </l>
            <l>Before the people—be as mounting flame</l>
            <l>To all that burned within them! Nay, I danced; </l>
            <l>There was no longing: I but did the deed</l>
            <l>Being moved to do it.</l>
            <l>(As FEDALMA speaks, she and <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.are gradually drawn nearer to each other.)</l>
            <l>Oh! I seemed new-waked </l>
            <l>To life in unison with a multitude—</l>
            <l>Feeling my soul upborne by all their souls, </l>
            <l>Floating within their gladness! Soon I lost </l>
            <l>All sense of separateness: Fedalma died</l>
            <l>As a star dies, and melts into the light.</l>
            <l>I was not, but joy was, and 1ove and triumph. </l>
            <l>Nay, my dear lord, I never could do aught </l>
            <l>But I must feel you present. And once done, </l>
            <l>Why, you must love it better than your wish.</l>
            <l>I pray you, say so—say, it was not wrong!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(While FEDALMA has been making this last appeal, they have gradually come close together, and at last embrace.)</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Were pure as that within . . . but 'tis a book </l>
            <l>Wherein you only read the poesy</l>
            <l>And miss all wicked meanings. Hence the need</l>
            <l>For trust—obedience—call it what you will—</l>
            <l>Towards him whose life will be your guard—towards me</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes!</l>
            <l>That very thing that when I am your wife </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I shall be something different,—shall be</l>
            <l>I know not what, a Duchess with new thoughts— </l>
            <l>For nobles never think like common men,</l>
            <l>Nor wives like maidens (Oh, you wot not yet </l>
            <l>How much I note, with all my ignorance)—</l>
            <l>That very thing has made me more resolve </l>
            <l>To have my will before I am your wife.</l>
            <l>How can the Duchess ever satisfy </l>
            <l>Fedalma's unwed eyes? and so to-day </l>
            <l>I scolded Iñez till she cried and went.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It was a guilty weakness: she knows well </l>
            <l>That since you pleaded to be left more free </l>
            <l>From tedious tendance and control of dames</l>
            <l>Whose rank matched better with your destiny, </l>
            <l>Her charge—my trust—was weightier.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nay, my lord,</l>
            <l>You must not blame her, dear old nurse. She cried. </l>
            <l>Why, you would have consented too, at last.</l>
            <l>I said such things! I was resolved to go,</l>
            <l>And see the streets, the shops, the men at work, </l>
            <l>The women, little children—everything,</l>
            <l>Just as it is when nobody looks on.</l>
            <l>And I have done it! We were out four hours. </l>
            <l>I feel so wise.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Had you but seen the town, </l>
            <l>You innocent naughtiness, not shown yourself— Shown yourself dancing—you bewilder me!— Frustrate my judgment with strange negatives </l>
            <l>That seem like poverty, and yet are wealth</l>
            <l>In precious womanliness, beyond the dower </l>
            <l>Of other women: wealth in virgin gold, Outweighing all their petty currency.</l>
            <l>You daring modesty! You shrink no more </l>
            <l>From gazing men than from the gazing flowers </l>
            <l>That, dreaming sunshine, open as you pass.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No, I should like the world to look at me</l>
            <l>With eyes of love that make a second day.</l>
            <l>I think your eyes would keep the life in me </l>
            <l>Though I had nought to feed on else. Their blue </l>
            <l>Is better than the heavens'—holds more love</l>
            <l>For me, Fedalma—is a little heaven</l>
            <l>For this one little world that looks up now.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O precious little world! you make the heaven</l>
            <l>As the earth makes the sky. But, dear, all eyes, </l>
            <l>Though looking even on you, have not a glance </l>
            <l>That cherishes . . . .</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah no, I meant to tell you— </l>
            <l>Tell how my dancing ended with a pang.</l>
            <l>There came a man, one among many more, </l>
            <l>But he came first, with iron on his limbs.</l>
            <l>And when the bell tolled, and the people prayed, </l>
            <l>And I stood pausing—then he looked at me.</l>
            <l>O Silva, such a man! I thought he rose </l>
            <l>From the dark place of long-imprisoned souls, </l>
            <l>To say that Christ had never come to them.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It was a look to shame a seraph’s joy,</l>
            <l>And make him sad in heaven. It found me there—Seemed to have travelled far to find me there</l>
            <l>And grasp me—claim this festal life of mine </l>
            <l>As heritage of sorrow, chill my blood</l>
            <l>With the cold iron of some unknown bonds. </l>
            <l>The gladness hurrying full within my veins </l>
            <l>Was sudden frozen, and I danced no more.</l>
            <l>But seeing you let loose the stream of joy, </l>
            <l>Mingling the present with the sweetest past. </l>
            <l>Yet, Silva, still I see him. Who is he?</l>
            <l>Who are those prisoners with him? Are they Moors?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No, they are Gypsies, strong and cunning knaves, </l>
            <l>A double gain to us by the Moors' loss:</l>
            <l>The man you mean—their chief—is an ally </l>
            <l>The infidel will miss. His look might chase</l>
            <l>A herd of monks, and make them fly more swift </l>
            <l>Than from St. Jerome's lion. Such vague fear, </l>
            <l>Such bird-like tremors when that savage glance Turned full upon you in your height of joy </l>
            <l>Was natural, was not worth emphasis.</l>
            <l>Forget it, dear. This hour is worth whole days</l>
            <l>When we are sundered. Danger urges us </l>
            <l>To quick resolve.</l>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>What danger? what resolve?</l>
            <l>I never felt chill shadow in my heart </l>
            <l>Until this sunset.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A dark enmity</l>
            <l>Plots how to sever us. And our defence </l>
            <l>Is speedy marriage, secretly achieved,</l>
            <l>Then publicly declared. Beseech you, dear, </l>
            <l>Grant me this confidence; do my will in this, </l>
            <l>Trusting the reasons why I overset</l>
            <l>All my own airy building raised so high </l>
            <l>Of bridal honours, marking when you step</l>
            <l>From off your maiden throne to come to me</l>
            <l>And bear the yoke of love. There is great need. </l>
            <l>I hastened home, carrying this prayer to you </l>
            <l>Within my heart. The bishop is my friend, </l>
            <l>Furthers our marriage, holds in enmity—</l>
            <l>Some whom we love not and who love not us.</l>
            <l>By this night's moon our priest will be despatched </l>
            <l>From Jaen. I shall march an escort strong</l>
            <l>To meet him. Ere a second sun from this </l>
            <l>Has risen—you consenting—we may wed.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Beforehand none</l>
            <l>Save Iñez and Don Alvar. But the vows </l>
            <l>Once safely binding us, my household all</l>
            <l>Shall know you as their Duchess. No man then </l>
            <l>Can aim a blow at you but through my breast, </l>
            <l>And what stains you must stain our ancient name; </l>
            <l>If any hate you I will take his hate,</l>
            <l>And wear it as a glove upon my helm;</l>
            <l>Nay, God himself will never have the power </l>
            <l>To strike you solely and leave me unhurt, </l>
            <l>He having made us one. Now put the seal </l>
            <l>Of your dear lips on that.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A solemn kiss?—</l>
            <l>Such as I gave you when you came that day </l>
            <l>From Cordova, when first we said we loved? </l>
            <l>When you had left the ladies of the Court </l>
            <l>For thirst to see me; and you told me so,</l>
            <l>And then I seemed to know why I had lived.</l>
            <l>I never knew before. A kiss like that?</l>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, yes, you face divine! When was our kiss </l>
            <l>Like any other?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nay, I cannot tell</l>
            <l>What other kisses are. But that one kiss</l>
            <l>Remains upon my lips. The angels, spirits, </l>
            <l>Creatures with finer sense, may see it there. </l>
            <l>And now another kiss that will not die, </l>
            <l>Saying, To-morrow I shall be your wife!</l>
            <l>(They kiss, and pause a moment, looking earnestly in each other's eyes. Then FEDALMA, breaking away from <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>. stands at a little distance from him with a look of roguish delight.)</l>
            <l>Now I am glad I saw the town to-day </l>
            <l>Before I am a Duchess—glad I gave</l>
            <l>This poor Fedalma all her wish. For once, </l>
            <l>Long years ago, I cried when Iñez said,</l>
            <l>"You are no more a little girl;" I grieved </l>
            <l>To part for ever from that little girl</l>
            <l>And all her happy world so near the ground. </l>
            <l>It must be sad to outlive aught we love.</l>
            <l>So I shall grieve a little for these days</l>
            <l>Of poor unwed Fedalma. Oh, they are sweet,</l>
            <l>And none will come just like them. Perhaps the wind</l>
            <l>Wails so in winter for the summers dead, </l>
            <l>And all sad sounds are nature's funeral cries</l>
            <l>For what has been and is not. Are they, Silva?</l>
            <l>(She comes nearer to him again, and lays her hand on his arm, looking up at him with melancholy.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>DON	SILVA.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Why, dearest, you began in merriment, And end as sadly as a widowed bird.</l>
            <l>Some touch mysterious has new-tuned your soul </l>
            <l>To melancholy sequence. You soared high</l>
            <l>In that wild flight of rapture when you danced,</l>
            <l>And now you droop. 'Tis arbitrary grief, Surfeit of happiness, that mourns for loss</l>
            <l>Of unwed love, which does but die like seed </l>
            <l>For fuller harvest of our tenderness.</l>
            <l>We in our wedded life shall know no loss.</l>
            <l>We shall new-date our years. What went before</l>
            <l>Will be the time of promise, shadows, dreams; </l>
            <l>But this, full revelation of great love.</l>
            <l>For rivers blent take in a broader heaven,</l>
            <l>And we shall blend our souls. Away with grief!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>When this dear head shall wear the double crown </l>
            <l>Of wife and Duchess—spiritually crowned</l>
            <l>With sworn espousal before God and man— </l>
            <l>Visibly crowned with jewels that bespeak </l>
            <l>The chosen sharer of my heritage—</l>
            <l>My love will gather perfectness, as thoughts </l>
            <l>That nourish us to magnanimity</l>
            <l>Grow perfect with more perfect utterance,</l>
            <l>Gathering full-shapen strength. And then these gems,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(<speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.draws FEDALMA towards the jewel-casket on the table, and opens it.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Helping the utterance of my soul's full choice, </l>
            <l>Will be the words made richer by just use, </l>
            <l>And have new meaning in their lustrousness.</l>
            <l>You know these jewels; they are precious signs</l>
            <l>Of long-transmitted honour, heightened still </l>
            <l>By worthy wearing; and I give them you— </l>
            <l>Ask you to take them—place our house's trust </l>
            <l>In her sure keeping whom my heart has found</l>
            <l>Worthiest, most beauteous.	These rubies—see—</l>
            <l>Were falsely placed if not upon your brow.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(FEDALMA, while <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.holds open the casket, bends over it, looking at the jewels with delight.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, I remember them. In childish days </l>
            <l>I felt as if they were alive and breathed. </l>
            <l>I used to sit with awe and look at them.</l>
            <l>And now they will be mine! I’ll put them on.</l>
            <l>Help me, my lord, and you shall see me now </l>
            <l>Somewhat as I shall look at Court with you, </l>
            <l>That we may know if I shall bear them well. </l>
            <l>I have a fear sometimes: I think your love</l>
            <l>Has never paused within your eyes to look, </l>
            <l>And only passes through them into mine.</l>
            <l>But when the Court is looking, and the queen, </l>
            <l>Your eyes will follow theirs. Oh, if you saw </l>
            <l>That I was other than you wished—'twere death!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.(taking up a jewel and placing it against her ear).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Nay, let us try. Take out your ear-ring, sweet. </l>
            <l>This ruby glows with longing for your ear.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (taking out her ear-rings, and then lifting up the other jewels, one by one).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Pray, fasten in the rubies.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(DON SILVA begins to put in the ear-ring.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I was right!</l>
            <l>These gems have life in them: their colours speak,</l>
            <l>Say what words fail of. So do many things— </l>
            <l>The scent of jasmine, and the fountain's plash, </l>
            <l>The moving shadows on the far-off hills,</l>
            <l>The slanting moonlight, and our clasping hands.</l>
            <l>O Silva, there's an ocean round our words</l>
            <l>That overflows and drowns them. Do you know </l>
            <l>Sometimes when we sit silent, and the air </l>
            <l>Breathes gently on us from the orange-trees,</l>
            <l>It seems that with the whisper of a word</l>
            <l>Our souls must shrink, get poorer, more apart.</l>
            <l>Is it not true?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, dearest, it is true.</l>
            <l>Speech is but broken light upon the depth </l>
            <l>Of the unspoken: even your loved words </l>
            <l>Float in the larger meaning of your voice </l>
            <l>As something dimmer.</l>
          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Ah! your lordly hands</l>
            <l>Will never fix that jewel. Let me try. </l>
            <l>Women's small finger-tips have eyes.</l>

            <l>What is that sound?—that jarring cruel sound? 'Tis there—outside.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>(She tries to start away towards the window, but <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.detains her.)</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It is the sound of fetters; sound of work </l>
            <l>Is not so dismal. Hark, they pass along! </l>
            <l>I know it is those Gypsy prisoners.</l>
            <l>I saw them, heard their chains. O horrible, </l>
            <l>To be in chains! Why, I with all my bliss</l>
            <l>Have longed sometimes to fly and be at large;</l>
            <l>Have felt imprisoned in my luxury</l>
            <l>With servants for my gaolers. O my lord, </l>
            <l>Do you not wish the world were different?</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It will be different when this war has ceased. </l>
            <l>You, wedding me, will make it different, </l>
            <l>Making one life more perfect.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>That is true!</l>
            <l>And I shall beg much kindness at your hands </l>
            <l>For those who are less happy than ourselves.—</l>
            <l>(Brightening) Oh I shall rule you! ask for many things </l>
            <l>Before the world, which you will not deny</l>
            <l>For very pride, lest men should say, "The Duke </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Doubtless, I shall persist</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Out of pure obstinacy feel myself </l>

            <l>Tell me, now, </l>
            <l>When all these cruel wars are at an end, </l>
            <l>And when we go to Court at Cordova, </l>
            <l>Or Seville, or Toledo—wait awhile,</l>
            <l>I must be farther off for you to see—</l>
            <l>(She retreats to a distance from him, and then advances slowly.)</l>
            <l>Now think (I would the tapers gave more light!) </l>
            <l>If when you show me at the tournaments </l>
            <l>Among the other ladies, they will say,</l>
            <l>"Duke Silva is well matched. His bride was nought,</l>
            <l>Was some poor foster-child, no man knows what; </l>
            <l>Yet is her carriage noble, all her robes</l>
            <l>Are worn with grace: she might have been well born." </l>
            <l>Will they say so? Think now we are at Court, </l>
            <l>And all eyes bent on me.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Fear not, my Duchess! </l>
            <l>Some knight who loves may say his lady-love</l>
            <l>Is fairer, being fairest. None can say</l>
            <l>Don Silva's bride might better fit her rank. </l>
            <l>You will make rank seem natural as kind, </l>
            <l>As eagle's plumage or the lion's might.</l>
            <l>A crown upon your brow would seem God-made.</l>

            <l>Then I am glad! I shall try on to-night </l>
            <l>The other jewels—have the tapers lit, </l>
            <l>And see the diamonds sparkle.</l>
            <l>(She goes to the casket again.)</l>
            <l>Here is gold—</l>
            <l>A necklace of pure gold—most finely wrought.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Fear of myself.</l>
            <l>For when I walk upon the battlements</l>
            <l>And see the river travelling toward the plain, </l>
            <l>The mountains screening all the world beyond,</l>
            <l>A longing comes that haunts me in my dreams—</l>
            <l>Dreams where I seem to spring from off the walls,</l>
            <l>And fly far, far away, until at last</l>
            <l>I find myself alone among the rocks, </l>
            <l>Remember then that I have left you—try </l>
            <l>To fly back to you—and my wings are gone!</l>
          </lg>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A wicked dream! If ever I left you,</l>
            <l>Even in dreams, it was some demon dragged me, </l>
            <l>And with fierce struggles I awaked myself.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It is a hateful dream, and when it comes—</l>
            <l>I mean, when in my waking hours there comes</l>
            <l>That longing to be free, I am afraid:</l>
            <l>I run down to my chamber, plait my hair, </l>
            <l>Weave colours in it, lay out all my gauds, </l>
            <l>And in my mind make new ones prettier.</l>
            <l>You see I have two minds, and both are foolish. </l>
            <l>Sometimes a torrent rushing through my soul </l>
            <l>Escapes in wild strange wishes; presently,</l>
            <l>It dwindles to a little babbling rill</l>
            <l>And plays among the pebbles and the flowers. </l>
            <l>Iñez will have it I lack broidery,</l>
            <l>Says nought else gives content to noble maids. </l>
            <l>But I have never broidered—never will.</l>
            <l>No, when I am a Duchess and a wife</l>
            <l>I shall ride forth—may I not?—by your side.</l>
          </lg>

            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, you shall ride upon a palfrey, black </l>
            <l>To match Bavieca. Not Queen Isabel</l>
            <l>Will be a sight more gladdening to men's eyes </l>
            <l>Than my dark queen Fedalma.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, but you,</l>
            <l>You are my king, and I shall tremble still</l>
            <l>With some great fear that throbs within my love. </l>
            <l>Does your love fear?</l>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, yes! all preciousness</l>
            <l>To mortal hearts is guarded by a fear.</l>
            <l>All love fears loss, and most that loss supreme, </l>
            <l>Its own perfection—seeing, feeling change </l>
            <l>From high to lower, dearer to less dear.</l>
            <l>Can love be careless? If we lost our love</l>
            <l>What should we find?—with this sweet Past torn off, </l>
            <l>Our lives deep scarred just where their beauty lay? </l>
            <l>The best we found thenceforth were still a worse: </l>
            <l>The only better is a Past that lives</l>
            <l>On through an added Present, stretching still </l>
            <l>In hope unchecked by shaming memories</l>
            <l>To life's last breath. And so I tremble too</l>
            <l>Before my queen Fedalma.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>That is just. </l>
            <l>'Twere hard of Love to make us women fear</l>
            <l>And leave you bold. Yet Love is not quite even. </l>
            <l>For feeble creatures, little birds and fawns,</l>
            <l>Are shaken more by fear, while large strong things </l>
            <l>Can bear it stoutly. So we women still</l>
            <l>Are not well dealt with. Yet I'd choose to be </l>
            <l>Fedalma loving Silva. You, my lord,</l>
            <l>Hold the worse share, since you must love poor me. </l>
            <l>But is it what we love, or how we love,</l>
            <l>That makes true good?</l>

            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O subtlety! for me </l>
            <l>'Tis what I love determines how I love.</l>
            <l>The goddess with pure rites reveals herself</l>
            <l>And makes pure worship.</l>

          </lg>

          <lg>
            <l>Yes—listening to this prayer. This very night </l>
            <l>I shall go forth. And you will rise with day </l>
            <l>And wait for me?</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I shall surely come.</l>
            <l>And then we shall be married. Now I go </l>
            <l>To audience fixed in Abderahman's tower. Farewell, love!</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Some chill dread possesses me!</l>

          <lg>
            <l><speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Oh, confidence has oft been evil augury,</l>
            <l>So dread may hold a promise. Sweet, farewell!</l>
            <l>I shall send tendance as I pass, to bear</l>
            <l>This casket to your chamber.—One more kiss.</l>
            <l>(Exit.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (when <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.is gone, returning to the casket, and looking dreamily at the jewels).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, now that good seems less impossible! </l>
            <l>Now it seems true that I shall be his wife, </l>
            <l>Be ever by his side, and make a part</l>
            <l>In all his purposes. . . . .</l>
            <l>These rubies greet me Duchess. How they glow!</l>
            <l>Their prisoned souls are throbbing like my own. </l>
            <l>Perchance they loved once, were ambitious, proud; </l>
            <l>Or do they only dream of wider life,</l>
            <l>Ache from intenseness, yearn to burst the wall </l>
            <l>Compact of crystal splendour, and to flood</l>
            <l>Some wider space with glory? Poor, poor gems!</l>
            <l>We must be patient in our prison-house,</l>
            <l>And find our space in loving. Pray you, love me. </l>
            <l>Let us be glad together. And you, gold—</l>
            <l>(She takes up the gold necklace.)</l>
            <l>You wondrous necklace—will you love me too, </l>
            <l>And be my amulet to keep me safe</l>
            <l>From eyes that hurt?</l>
            <l>(She spreads out the necklace, meaning to clasp it on her neck. Then pauses, startled, holding it before her.)</l>
            <l>Why, it is magical!</l>
            <l>He says he never wore it—yet these lines—</l>
            <l>Nay, if he had, I should remember well</l>
            <l>'Twas he, no other. And these twisted lines— </l>
            <l>They seem to speak to me as writing would, </l>
            <l>To bring a message from the dead, dead past </l>
            <l>What is their secret? Are they characters?</l>
            <l>I never learned them; yet they stir some sense </l>
            <l>That once I dreamed—I have forgotten what.</l>
            <l>Or was it life? Perhaps I lived before</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>In some strange world where first my soul was shaped, </l>
            <l>And all this passionate love, and joy, and pain, </l>
            <l>That come, I know not whence, and sway my deeds, </l>
            <l>Are old imperious memories, blind yet strong,</l>
            <l>That this world stirs within me; as this chain </l>
            <l>Stirs some strange certainty of visions gone, </l>
            <l>And all my mind is as an eye that stares</l>
            <l>Into the darkness painfully.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(While FEDALMA has been looking at the necklace, JUAN has entered, and finding himself unobserved by her, says at last,)</l>
            <l>Señora!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> starts, and gathering the necklace together, turns round—</l>
            <l>Oh, Juan, it is you!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
            <l>I met the Duke— </l>
            <l>Had waited long without, no matter why— </l>
            <l>And when he ordered one to wait on you </l>
            <l>And carry forth a burthen you would give, </l>
            <l>I prayed for leave to be the servitor.</l>
            <l>Don Silva owes me twenty granted wishes </l>
            <l>That I have never tendered, lacking aught</l>
            <l>That I could wish for and a Duke could grant; </l>
            <l>But this one wish to serve you, weighs as much </l>
            <l>As twenty other longings.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (smiling).</l>
            <l>That sounds well.</l>
            <l>You turn your speeches prettily as songs.</l>
            <l>But I will not forget the many days</l>
            <l>You have neglected me. Your pupil learns </l>
            <l>But little from you now. Her studies flag. </l>
            <l>The Duke says, "That is idle Juan's way: </l>
            <l>Poets must rove—are honey-sucking birds</l>
            <l>And know not constancy." Said he quite true?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
            <l>O lady, constancy has kind and rank.</l>
            <l>One man's is lordly, plump, and bravely clad, </l>
            <l>Holds its head high, and tells the world its name: </l>
            <l>Another man's is beggared, must go bare,</l>
            <l>And shiver through the world, the jest of all, </l>
            <l>But that it puts the motley on, and plays </l>
            <l>Itself the jester. But I see you hold</l>
            <l>The Gypsy's necklace: it is quaintly wrought.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
            <l>The Gypsy's? Do you know its history?</l>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No farther back than when I saw it taken </l>
            <l>From off its wearer's neck—the Gypsy chief's.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (eagerly).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>What! he who paused, at tolling of the bell, </l>
            <l>Before me in the Plaça?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, I saw</l>
            <l>His look fixed on you.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Know you aught of him?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Something and nothing—as I know the sky, </l>
            <l>Or some great story of the olden time</l>
            <l>That hides a secret. I have oft talked with him. </l>
            <l>He seems to say much, yet is but a wizard</l>
            <l>Who draws down rain by sprinkling; throws me out </l>
            <l>Some pregnant text that urges comment; casts</l>
            <l>A sharp-hooked question, baited with such skill</l>
            <l>It needs must catch the answer.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It is hard</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>That such a man should be a prisoner— </l>
            <l>Be chained to work.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Oh, he is dangerous!</l>
            <l>Granáda with this Zarca for a king</l>
            <l>Might still maim Christendom. He is of those</l>
            <l>Who steal the keys from snoring Destiny </l>
            <l>And make the prophets lie. A Gypsy, too, </l>
            <l>Suckled by hunted beasts, whose mother-milk </l>
            <l>Has filled his veins with hate.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I thought his eyes</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Spoke not of hatreds—seemed to say he bore </l>
            <l>The pain of those who never could be saved. </l>
            <l>What if the Gypsies are but savage beasts </l>
            <l>And must be hunted?—let them be set free, </l>
            <l>Have benefit of chase, or stand at bay</l>
            <l>And fight for life and offspring. Prisoners!</l>
            <l>Oh! they have made their fires beside the streams, </l>
            <l>Their walls have been the rocks, the pillared pines, </l>
            <l>Their roof the living sky that breathes with light:</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>They may well hate a cage, like strong-winged birds, </l>
            <l>Like me, who have no wings, but only wishes.</l>
            <l>I will beseech the Duke to set them free.</l>
          </lg>

            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Pardon me, lady, if I seem to warn,</l>
            <l>Or try to play the sage. What if the Duke </l>
            <l>Loved not to hear of Gypsies? if their name </l>
            <l>Were poisoned for him once, being used amiss ? </l>
            <l>I speak not as of fact. Our nimble souls</l>
            <l>Can spin an insubstantial universe </l>
            <l>Suiting our mood, and call it possible, </l>
            <l>Sooner than see one grain with eye exact</l>

            <l>Fear not, Juan.</l>
            <l>Your words bring daylight with them when you speak. </l>
            <l>I understand your care. But I am brave—</l>

            <l>A Street by the Castle. JUAN leans against a parapet, in moonlight, and touches his lute half unconsciously. PEPITA stands on tiptoe watching him, and then advances till her shadow falls in front of him. He looks towards her. A piece of white drapery thrown over her head catches the moon­light.</l>

            <l>We old, old poets, if we kept our hearts,</l>

            <l>Loved me well, she said,</l>

            <l>Hiding the more fair, </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A vaulted room all stone. The light shed from a high lamp. Wooden chairs, a desk, book-shelves. The PRIOR, in white frock, a black rosary with a crucifix of ebony and ivory at his side, is walking up and down, holding a written paper in his hands, which are clasped behind him.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>What if this witness lies? he says he heard her </l>
            <l>Counting her blasphemies on a rosary,</l>
            <l>And in a bold discourse with Salomo,</l>
            <l>Say that the Host was nought but ill-mixed flour, </l>
            <l>That it was mean to pray—she never prayed.</l>
            <l>I know the man who wrote this for a cur, </l>
            <l>Who follows Don Diego, sees life's good</l>
            <l>In scraps my nephew flings to him. What then?</l>
            <l>Particular lies may speak a general truth.</l>
            <l>I guess him false, but know her heretic—</l>
            <l>Know her for Satan's instrument, bedecked</l>
            <l>With heathenish charms, luring the souls of men </l>
            <l>To damning trust in good unsanctified.</l>
            <l>Let her be prisoned—questioned—she will give </l>
            <l>Witness against herself, that were this false. . .</l>
            <l>(He looks at the paper again and reads, then again thrusts it behind him.)</l>
            <l>The matter and the colour are not false:</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The form concerns the witness not the judge; </l>
            <l>For proof is gathered by the sifting mind, </l>
            <l>Not given in crude and formal circumstance.</l>
            <l>Suspicion is a heaven-sent lamp, and I—</l>
            <l>I, watchman of the Holy Office, bear</l>
            <l>That lamp in trust. I will keep faithful watch. </l>
            <l>The Holy Inquisition's discipline</l>
            <l>Is mercy, saving her, if penitent—</l>
            <l>God grant it!—else—root up the poison-plant, </l>
            <l>Though 'twere a lily with a golden heart!</l>
            <l>This spotless maiden with her pagan soul</l>
            <l>Is the arch-enemy's trap: he turns his back </l>
            <l>On all the prostitutes, and watches her</l>
            <l>To see her poison men with false belief</l>
            <l>In rebel virtues. She has poisoned Silva ; </l>
            <l>His shifting mind, dangerous in fitfulness, </l>
            <l>Strong in the contradiction of itself, </l>
            <l>Carries his young ambitions wearily,</l>
            <l>As holy vows regretted. Once he seemed</l>
            <l>The fresh-oped flower of Christian knighthood, born </l>
            <l>For feats of holy daring; and I said:</l>
            <l>"That half of life which I, as monk, renounce, </l>
            <l>Shall be fulfilled in him: Silva will be</l>
            <l>That saintly noble, that wise warrior, </l>
            <l>That blameless excellence in worldly gifts </l>
            <l>I would have been, had I not asked to live</l>
            <l>The higher life of man impersonal</l>
            <l>Who reigns o’er all things by refusing all.”</l>
            <l>What is his promise now? Apostasy</l>
            <l>From every high intent:—languid, nay, gone, </l>
            <l>The prompt devoutness of a generous heart, </l>
            <l>The strong obedience of a reverent will,</l>
            <l>That breathes the Church's air and sees her light, </l>
            <l>He peers and strains with feeble questioning,</l>
            <l>Or else he jests. He thinks I know it not— </l>
            <l>I who have read the history of his lapse,</l>
            <l>As clear as it is writ in the angel's book.</l>
            <l>He will defy me—flings great words at me— </l>
            <l>Me who have governed all our house's acts,</l>
            <l>Since I, a stripling, ruled his stripling father. </l>
            <l>This maiden is the cause, and if they wed, </l>
            <l>The Holy War may count a captain lost.</l>
            <l>For better he were dead than keep his place, </l>
            <l>And fill it infamously: in God's war </l>
            <l>Slackness is infamy. Shall I stand by</l>
            <l>And let the tempter win? defraud Christ's cause, </l>
            <l>And blot his banner?—all for scruples weak</l>
            <l>Of pity towards their young and frolicsome blood; </l>
            <l>Or nice discrimination of the tool</l>
            <l>By which my hand shall work a sacred rescue? </l>
            <l>The fence of rules is for the purblind crowd; </l>
            <l>They walk by averaged precepts: sovereign men,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Seeing by God's light, see the general </l>
            <l>By seeing all the special—own no rule</l>
            <l>But their full vision of the moment's worth. </l>
            <l>'Tis so God governs, using wicked men— </l>
            <l>Nay, scheming fiends, to work his purposes. </l>
            <l>Evil that good may come? Measure the good </l>
            <l>Before you say what's evil. Perjury?</l>
            <l>I scorn the perjurer, but I will use him </l>
            <l>To serve the holy truth. There is no lie</l>
            <l>Save in his soul, and let his soul be judged. </l>
            <l>I know the truth, and act upon the truth.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O God, thou knowest that my will is pure.</l>
            <l>Thy servant owns nought for himself, his wealth </l>
            <l>Is but obedience. And I have sinned</l>
            <l>In keeping small respects of human love—</l>
            <l>Calling it mercy. Mercy? Where evil is</l>
            <l>True mercy holds a sword. Mercy would save. </l>
            <l>Save whom? Save serpents, locusts, wolves?</l>
            <l>Or out of pity let the idiots gorge</l>
            <l>Within a famished town? Or save the gains </l>
            <l>Of men who trade in poison lest they starve?</l>
            <l>Save all things mean and foul that clog the earth </l>
            <l>Stifling the better? Save the fools who cling </l>
            <l>For refuge round their hideous idol's limbs,</l>
            <l>So leave the idol grinning unconsumed,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And save the fools to breed idolaters?</l>
            <l>O mercy worthy of the licking hound</l>
            <l>That knows no future but its feeding time!</l>
            <l>Mercy has eyes that pierce the ages—sees </l>
            <l>From heights divine of the eternal purpose</l>
            <l>Far-scattered consequence in its vast sum; </l>
            <l>Chooses to save, but with illumined vision </l>
            <l>Sees that to save is greatly to destroy.</l>
            <l>'Tis so the Holy Inquisition sees: its wrath </l>
            <l>Is fed from the strong heart of wisest love.</l>
            <l>For love must needs make hatred. He who loves </l>
            <l>God and his law must hate the foes of God.</l>
            <l>And I have sinned in being merciful:</l>
            <l>Being slack in hate, I have been slack in love.</l>
            <l>(He takes the crucifix and holds it up before him.) </l>
            <l>Thou shuddering, bleeding, thirsting, dying God, </l>
            <l>Thou Man of Sorrows, scourged and bruised and torn, </l>
            <l>Suffering to save—wilt thou not judge the world?</l>
            <l>This arm which held the children, this pale hand </l>
            <l>That gently touched the eyelids of the blind, </l>
            <l>And opened passive to the cruel nail,</l>
            <l>Shall one day stretch to leftward of thy throne,</l>
            <l>Charged with the power that makes the lightning strong,</l>
            <l>And hurl thy foes to everlasting hell</l>
            <l>And thou, Immaculate Mother, Virgin mild,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Thou sevenfold-pierced, thou pitying, pleading Queen, </l>
            <l>Shalt see and smile, while the black filthy souls </l>
            <l>Sink with foul weight to their eternal place, </l>
            <l>Purging the Holy Light. Yea, I have sinned</l>
            <l>And called it mercy. But I shrink no more. </l>
            <l>To-morrow morn this temptress shall be safe </l>
            <l>Under the Holy Inquisition's key.</l>
            <l>He thinks to wed her, and defy me then, </l>
            <l>She being shielded by our house's name. </l>
            <l>But he shall never wed her. I have said.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The time is come. Exurge, Domine,</l>
            <l>Judica causam tuam. Let thy foes</l>
            <l>Be driven as the smoke before the wind, </l>
            <l>And melt like wax upon the furnace lip!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A large chamber richly furnished opening on a terrace­garden, the trees visible through the window in faint moonlight. Flowers hanging about the window, lit up by the tapers. The casket of jewels open on a table. The gold necklace lying near. FEDALMA, splendidly dressed and adorned with pearls and rubies, is walking up and down.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>So soft a night was never made for sleep, </l>
            <l>But for the waking of the finer sense</l>
            <l>To every murmuring and gentle sound, </l>
            <l>To subtlest odours, pulses, visitings</l>
            <l>That touch our frames with wings too delicate </l>
            <l>To be discerned amid the blare of day.</l>
            <l>(She pauses near the window to gather some jasmine: then walks again.)</l>
            <l>Surely these flowers keep happy watch—their breath</l>
            <l>Is their fond memory of the loving light. </l>
            <l>I often rue the hours I lose in sleep:</l>
            <l>It is a bliss too brief, only to see</l>
            <l>This glorious world, to hear the voice of love, </l>
            <l>To feel the touch, the breath of tenderness, </l>
            <l>And then to rest as from a spectacle.</l>
            <l>I need the curtained stillness of the night </l>
            <l>To live through all my happy hours again</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>With more selection—cull them quite away </l>
            <l>From blemished moments. Then in loneliness </l>
            <l>The face that bent before me in the day</l>
            <l>Rises in its own light, more vivid seems </l>
            <l>Painted upon the dark, and ceaseless glows</l>
            <l>With sweet solemnity of gazing love,</l>
            <l>Till like the heavenly blue it seems to grow </l>
            <l>Nearer, more kindred, and more cherishing, </l>
            <l>Mingling with all my being. Then the words, </l>
            <l>The tender low-toned words come back again, </l>
            <l>With repetition welcome as the chime</l>
            <l>Of softly hurrying brooks—"My only love—</l>
            <l>My love while life shall last—my own Fedalma! "</l>
            <l>Oh it is mine—the joy that once has been!</l>
            <l>Poor eager hope is but a stammerer, </l>
            <l>Must listen dumbly to great memory,</l>
            <l>Who makes our bliss the sweeter by her telling.</l>
            <l>(She pauses a moment musingly.) </l>
            <l>But that dumb hope is still a sleeping guard </l>
            <l>Whose quiet rhythmic breath saves me from dread </l>
            <l>In this fair paradise. For if the earth</l>
            <l>Broke off with flower-fringed edge, visibly sheer, </l>
            <l>Leaving no footing for my forward step</l>
            <l>But empty blackness. . .</l>
            <l>Nay, there is no fear— </l>
            <l>They will renew themselves, day and my joy, </l>
            <l>And all that past which is securely mine,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Will be the hidden root that nourishes </l>
            <l>Our still unfolding, ever-ripening love!</l>
            <l>(While she is uttering the last words, a little bird falls softly on the floor behind her; she hears the light sound of its fall, and turns round.)</l>
            <l>Did something enter? . . . .</l>
            <l>Yes, this little bird . . . .</l>
            <l>(She lifts it.)</l>
            <l>Dead and yet warm; 'twas seeking sanctuary, </l>
            <l>And died, perhaps of fright, at the altar foot. </l>
            <l>Stay, there is something tied beneath the wing!</l>
            <l>A strip of linen, streaked with blood—what blood? </l>
            <l>The streaks are written words—are sent to me—</l>
            <l>O God, are sent to me! Dear child, Fedalma, </l>
            <l>Be brave, give no alarm—your Father comes!</l>
            <l>(She lets the bird fall again.)</l>
            <l>My Father . . . comes . . . my Father . . .</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>(She turns in quivering expectation toward the window. There is perfect stillness a few moments until ZARCA appears at the win­dow. He enters quickly and noiselessly; then stands still at his full height, and at a distance from FEDALMA.)</l>

            <l>Was played with by your fingers when it hung </l>
            <l>About my neck, full fifteen years ago.</l>

            <l>The very day </l>
            <l>I lost you, when you wore a tiny gown </l>
            <l>Of scarlet cloth with golden broidery:</l>
            <l>'Twas clasped in front by coins—two golden coins. </l>
            <l>The one upon the left was split in two</l>
            <l>Across the king's head, right from brow to nape, </l>
            <l>A dent i' the middle nicking in the cheek.</l>
            <l>You see I know the little gown by heart.</l>

            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (growing paler and more tremulous).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes. It is true—I have the gown—the clasps— </l>
            <l>The braid—sore tarnished:—it is long ago!</l>
            <l><speaker>ZARCA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But yesterday to me; for till to-day </l>
            <l>I saw you always as that little child.</l>
            <l>And when they took my necklace from me, still </l>
            <l>Your fingers played about it on my neck,</l>
            <l>And still those buds of fingers on your feet </l>
            <l>Caught in its meshes as you seemed to climb </l>
            <l>Up to my shoulder. You were not stolen all. </l>
            <l>You had a double life fed from my heart. . . .</l>
            <l>(FEDALMA, letting fall the necklace, makes an impulsive movement towards him, with outstretched hands.)</l>
            <l>The Gypsy father loves his children well.</l>

            <l>How came it that you sought me—no—I mean </l>

            <l>Poor child! I see—your father and his rags </l>
            <l>Are welcome as the piercing wintry wind</l>
            <l>Within this silken chamber. It is well.</l>
            <l>I would not have a child who stooped to feign, </l>
            <l>And aped a sudden love. Better, true hate.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>I lost you as a man may lose a gem</l>
            <l>Wherein he has compressed his total wealth,</l>
            <l>Or the right hand whose cunning makes him great:</l>
            <l>I lost you by a trivial accident.</l>
            <l>Marauding Spaniards, sweeping like a storm </l>
            <l>Over a spot within the Moorish bounds,</l>
            <l>Near where our camp lay, doubtless snatched you up, </l>
            <l>When Zind, your nurse, as she confessed, was urged </l>
            <l>By burning thirst to wander toward the stream,</l>
            <l>And leave you on the sand some paces off </l>
            <l>Playing with pebbles, while she dog-like lapped. </l>
            <l>'Twas so I lost you—never saw you more</l>
            <l>Until to-day I saw you dancing! Saw </l>
            <l>The daughter of the Zíncalo make sport</l>
            <l>For those who spit upon her people's name.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It was not sport. What if the world looked on?— </l>
            <l>I danced for joy—for love of all the world.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But when you looked at me my joy was stabbed—</l>
            <l>Stabbed with your pain. I wondered . . . now I know . . .</l>
            <l>It was my father's pain.</l>
            <l>(She pauses a moment with eyes bent downward, during which ZARCA examines her face. Then she says quickly,)</l>
            <l>How were you sure </l>
            <l>At once I was your child?</l>

            <l>I had witness strong </l>
            <l>As any Cadi needs, before I saw you!</l>
            <l>I fitted all my memories with the chat</l>
            <l>Of one named Juan—one whose rapid talk</l>
            <l>Showers like the blossoms from a light-twigged shrub, </l>
            <l>If you but cough beside it. I learned all</l>
            <l>The story of your Spanish nurture—all</l>
            <l>The promise of your fortune. When at last </l>
            <l>I fronted you, my little maid full-grown, </l>
            <l>Belief was turned to vision: then I saw</l>
            <l>That she whom Spaniards called the bright Fedalma— </l>
            <l>The little red-frocked foundling three years old— </l>
            <l>Grown to such perfectness the Spanish Duke</l>
            <l>Had wooed her for his Duchess—was the child, </l>
            <l>Sole offspring of my flesh, that Lambra bore</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>One hour before the Christian, hunting us, </l>
            <l>Hurried her on to death. Therefore I sought— </l>
            <l>Therefore I come to claim you—claim my child, </l>
            <l>Not from the Spaniard, not from him who robbed, </l>
            <l>But from herself.</l>

          <lg>

            <l>Untutored, unbefriended, unendowed;</l>
            <l>No favourites of heaven or of men.</l>
            <l>Therefore I cling to them! Therefore no lure </l>
            <l>Shall draw me to disown them, or forsake</l>
            <l>The meagre wandering herd that lows for help </l>
            <l>And needs me for its guide, to seek my pasture </l>
            <l>Among the well-fed beeves that graze at will.</l>
            <l>Because our race has no great memories, </l>
            <l>I will so live, it shall remember me</l>
            <l>For deeds of such divine beneficence</l>
            <l>As rivers have, that teach men what is good</l>
            <l>By blessing them. I have been schooled—have caught</l>
            <l>Lore from the Hebrew, deftness from the Moor— </l>
            <l>Know the rich heritage, the milder life,</l>
            <l>Of nations fathered by a mighty Past;</l>
            <l>But were our race accursed (as they who make</l>

            <l>Vibrate prophetic in its kindred frame,</l>
            <l>And make it spread its wings and poise itself</l>
            <l>For the eagle's flight. Hear what you have to do.</l>
            <l>(FEDALMA stands half averted, as if she dreaded the effect of his looks and words.)</l>
            <l>My comrades even now file off their chains</l>
            <l>In a low turret by the battlements,</l>
            <l>Where we were locked with slight and sleepy guard—</l>
            <l>We who had files hid in our shaggy hair, </l>
            <l>And possible ropes that waited but our will</l>
            <l>In half our garments. Oh, the Moorish blood</l>
            <l>Runs thick and warm to us, though thinned by chrism. </l>
            <l>I found a friend among our gaolers—one</l>
            <l>Who loves the Gypsy as the Moor's ally.</l>
            <l>I know the secrets of this fortress. Listen. </l>
            <l>Hard by yon terrace is a narrow stair,</l>
            <l>Cut in the living rock, and at one point</l>
            <l>In its slow straggling course it branches off </l>
            <l>Towards a low wooden door, that art has bossed </l>
            <l>To such unevenness, it seems one piece</l>
            <l>With the rough-hewn rock. Open that door, it leads </l>
            <l>Through a broad passage burrowed under-ground</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A good half-mile out to the open plain: </l>
            <l>Made for escape, in dire extremity</l>
            <l>From siege or burning, of the house's wealth </l>
            <l>In women or in gold. To find that door </l>
            <l>Needs one who knows the number of the steps </l>
            <l>Just to the turning-point; to open it,</l>
            <l>Needs one who knows the secret of the bolt. </l>
            <l>You have that secret: you will ope that door, </l>
            <l>And fly with us.</l>

            <l>At touch of your great thoughts; nay, in my blood </l>
            <l>There streams the sense unspeakable of kind,</l>

            <l>They played about the gold upon your neck.</l>
            <l>I do believe it, for their tiny pulse </l>
            <l>Made record of it in the inmost coil</l>
            <l>Of growing memory. But see them now!</l>
            <l>Oh, they have made fresh record; twined themselves</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>With other throbbing hands whose pulses feed </l>
            <l>Not memories only but a blended life—</l>

            <l>So closing up a myriad avenues</l>
            <l>To misery yet unwrought? My soul is faint— </l>
            <l>Will these sharp pangs buy any certain good?</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Nay, never falter: no great deed is done </l>
            <l>By falterers who ask for certainty.</l>
            <l>No good is certain, but the steadfast mind, </l>
            <l>The undivided will to seek the good:</l>
            <l>'Tis that compels the elements, and wrings </l>
            <l>A human music from the indifferent air.</l>
            <l>The greatest gift the hero leaves his race </l>
            <l>Is to have been a hero. Say we fail!—</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>We feed the high tradition of the world,</l>
            <l>And leave our spirit in our children's breasts.</l>

            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (unclasping her jewelled belt, and </l>
            <l>throwing it down).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, say that we shall fail! I will not count </l>
            <l>On aught but being faithful. I will take </l>
            <l>This yearning self of mine and strangle it.</l>
            <l>I will not be half-hearted: never yet </l>
            <l>Fedalma did aught with a wavering soul.</l>
            <l>Die, my young joy—die, all my hungry hopes— </l>
            <l>The milk you cry for from the breast of life</l>
            <l>Is thick with curses. Oh, all fatness here </l>
            <l>Snatches its meat from leanness—feeds on graves. </l>
            <l>I will seek nothing but to shun base joy.</l>
            <l>The saints were cowards who stood by to see </l>
            <l>Christ crucified: they should have flung themselves </l>
            <l>Upon the Roman spears, and died in vain— </l>
            <l>The grandest death, to die in vain—for love </l>
            <l>Greater than sways the forces of the world!</l>
            <l>That death shall be my bridegroom. I will wed </l>

            <l>The fate which made you Zíncala, as his fate</l>

            <l>Yes, I will write, but he— </l>
            <l>Oh, he would know it—he would never think</l>
            <l>The chain that dragged me from him could be aught </l>
            <l>But scorching iron entering in my soul</l>

            <l>Silva, sole love—he came—my father came.</l>
            <l>I am the daughter of the Gypsy chief</l>
            <l>Who means to be the Saviour of our tribe. </l>
            <l>He calls on me to live for his great end.</l>
            <l>To live? nay, die for it. Fedalma dies </l>
            <l>In leaving Silva: all that lives henceforth</l>
            <l>Is the poor Zíncala. (She rises.)</l>

          <lg>
            <l>SILVA was marching homeward while the moon </l>
            <l>Still shed mild brightness like the far-off hope </l>
            <l>Of those pale virgin lives that wait and pray.</l>
            <l>The stars thin-scattered made the heavens large, </l>
            <l>Bending in slow procession; in the east </l>
            <l>Emergent from the dark waves of the hills, </l>
            <l>Seeming a little sister of the moon,</l>
            <l>Glowed Venus all unquenched. Silva, in haste, </l>
            <l>Exultant and yet anxious, urged his troop</l>
            <l>To quick and quicker march: he had delight </l>
            <l>In forward stretching shadows, in the gleams </l>
            <l>That travelled on the armour of the van,</l>
            <l>And in the many-hoofed sound: in all that told </l>
            <l>Of hurrying movement to o'ertake his thought </l>
            <l>Already in Bedmár, close to Fedalma,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Leading her forth a wedded bride, fast vowed,</l>
            <l>Defying Father Isidor. His glance</l>
            <l>Took in with much content the priest who rode </l>
            <l>Firm in his saddle, stalwart and broad-backed, </l>
            <l>Crisp-curled, and comfortably secular,</l>
            <l>Right in the front of him. But by degrees </l>
            <l>Stealthily faint, disturbing with slow loss </l>
            <l>That showed not yet full promise of a gain,</l>
            <l>The light was changing, and the watch intense </l>
            <l>Of moon and stars seemed weary, shivering:</l>
            <l>The sharp white brightness passed from off the rocks </l>
            <l>Carrying the shadows: beauteous Night lay dead </l>
            <l>Under the pall of twilight, and the love-star </l>
            <l>Sickened and shrank. The troop was winding now </l>
            <l>Upward to where a pass between the peaks</l>
            <l>Seemed like an opened gate—to Silva seemed </l>
            <l>An outer-gate of heaven, for through that pass </l>
            <l>They entered his own valley, near Bedmár.</l>
            <l>Sudden within the pass a horseman rose, </l>
            <l>One instant dark upon the banner pale </l>
            <l>Of rock-cut sky, the next in motion swift</l>
            <l>With hat and plume high shaken—ominous. </l>
            <l>Silva had dreamed his future, and the dream </l>
            <l>Held not this messenger. A minute more— </l>
            <l>It was his friend Don Alvar whom he saw </l>
            <l>Reining his horse up, face to face with him,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Sad as the twilight, all his clothes ill-girt—</l>
            <l>As if he had been roused to see one die,</l>
            <l>And brought the news to him whom death had robbed. </l>
            <l>Silva believed he saw the worst—the town</l>
            <l>Stormed by the infidel—or, could it be</l>
            <l>Fedalma dragged?—no, there was not yet time. </l>
            <l>But with a marble face, he only said,</l>
            <l>"What evil, Alvar? ''</l>
            <l>"What this paper speaks."</l>
            <l>It was Fedalma’s letter folded close</l>
            <l>And mute as yet for Silva. But his friend </l>
            <l>Keeping it still sharp-pinched against his breast,  </l>
            <l>“It will smite hard, my lord: a private grief.</l>
            <l>I would not have you pause to read it here.</l>
            <l>Let us ride on—we use the moments best, </l>
            <l>Reaching the town with speed. The smaller ill </l>
            <l>Is that our Gypsy prisoners have escaped."</l>
            <l>"No more. Give me the paper—nay, I know—</l>
            <l>'Twill make no difference. Bid them march on faster." </l>
            <l>Silva pushed forward—held the paper crushed</l>
            <l>Close in his right. "They have imprisoned her," </l>
            <l>He said to Alvar in low, hard-cut tones,</l>
            <l>Like a dream-speech of slumbering revenge.</l>
            <l>"No—when they came to fetch her she was gone." </l>
            <l>Swift as the right touch on a spring, that word </l>
            <l>Made Silva read the letter. She was gone!</l>
            <l>But not into locked darkness—only gone </l>
            <l>Into free air—where he might find her yet. </l>
            <l>The bitter loss had triumph in it—what!</l>
            <l>They would have seized her with their holy claws </l>
            <l>The Prior's sweet morsel of despotic hate</l>
            <l>Was snatched from off his lips. This misery </l>
            <l>Had yet a taste of joy. </l>
            <l>But she was gone! </l>
            <l>The sun had risen, and in the castle walls</l>
            <l>The light grew strong and stronger. Silva walked </l>
            <l>Through the long corridor where dimness yet </l>
            <l>Cherished a lingering, flickering, dying hope: </l>
            <l>Fedalma still was there—he could not see</l>
            <l>The vacant place that once her presence filled. </l>
            <l>Can we believe that the dear dead are gone? </l>
            <l>Love in sad weeds forgets the funeral day, </l>
            <l>Opens the chamber door and almost smiles—</l>
            <l>Then sees the sunbeams pierce athwart the bed </l>
            <l>Where the pale face is not. So Silva's joy, </l>
            <l>Like the sweet habit of caressing hands</l>
            <l>That seek the memory of another hand, </l>
            <l>Still lived on fitfully in spite of words,</l>
            <l>And, numbing thought with vague illusion, dulled </l>
            <l>The slow and steadfast beat of certainty.</l>
            <l>But in the rooms inexorable light</l>
            <l>Streamed through the open window where she fled,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Streamed on the belt and coronet thrown down—</l>
            <l>Mute witnesses—sought out the typic ring</l>
            <l>That sparkled on the crimson, solitary, </l>
            <l>Wounding him like a word. O hateful light! </l>
            <l>It filled the chambers with her absence, glared</l>
            <l>On all the motionless things her hand had touched, </l>
            <l>Motionless all—save where old Iñez lay</l>
            <l>Sunk on the floor holding her rosary, </l>
            <l>Making its shadow tremble with her fear.</l>
            <l>And Silva passed her by because she grieved: </l>
            <l>It was the lute, the gems, the pictured heads, </l>
            <l>He longed to crush, because they made no sign </l>
            <l>But of insistance that she was not there,</l>
            <l>She who had filled his sight and hidden them. </l>
            <l>He went forth on the terrace tow'rd the stairs, </l>
            <l>Saw the rained petals of the cistus flowers </l>
            <l>Crushed by large feet; but on one shady spot</l>
            <l>Far down the steps, where dampness made a home, </l>
            <l>He saw a footprint delicate-slippered, small,</l>
            <l>So dear to him, he searched for sister-prints, </l>
            <l>Searched in the rock-hewn passage with a lamp </l>
            <l>For other trace of her, and found a glove;</l>
            <l>But not Fedalma's. It was Juan's glove,</l>
            <l>Tasselled, perfumed, embroidered with his name, </l>
            <l>A gift of dames. Then Juan, too, was gone?</l>
            <l>Full-mouthed conjecture, hurrying through the town,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Had spread the tale already: it was he</l>
            <l>That helped the Gypsies' flight. He talked and sang </l>
            <l>Of nothing but the Gypsies and Fedalma.</l>
            <l>He drew the threads together, wove the plan; </l>
            <l>Had lingered out by moonlight, had been seen </l>
            <l>Strolling, as was his wont, within the walls, </l>
            <l>Humming his ditties. So Don Alvar told, </l>
            <l>Conveying outside rumour. But the Duke, </l>
            <l>Making of haughtiness a visor closed,</l>
            <l>Would show no agitated front in quest</l>
            <l>Of small disclosures. What her writing bore </l>
            <l>Had been enough. He knew that she was gone, </l>
            <l>Knew why. </l>
            <l>"The Duke," some said, "will send a force, </l>
            <l>Retake the prisoners, and bring back his bride."</l>
            <l>But others, winking, "Nay, her wedding dress</l>
            <l>Would be the san-benito. 'Tis a fight</l>
            <l>Between the Duke and Prior. Wise bets will choose </l>
            <l>The churchman: he's the iron, and the Duke . . . .”</l>
            <l>"Is a fine piece of pottery," said mine host, </l>
            <l>Softening the sarcasm with a bland regret.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>There was the thread that in the new-made knot </l>
            <l>Of obstinate circumstance seemed hardest drawn, </l>
            <l>Vexed most the sense of Silva, in these hours</l>
            <l>Who stood as if upon the smoking mount</l>
            <l>Of fresh and angry pain—there, in that fight</l>
            <l>Against a foe whose sword was magical,</l>
            <l>His shield invisible terrors—against a foe</l>
            <l>Who stood as if upon the smoking mount</l>
            <l>Ordaining plagues. All else, Fedalma's flight, </l>
            <l>The father's claim, her Gypsy birth disclosed, </l>
            <l>Were momentary crosses, hindrances</l>
            <l>A Spanish noble might despise. This Chief </l>
            <l>Might still be treated with, would not refuse </l>
            <l>A proffered ransom, which would better serve </l>
            <l>Gypsy prosperity, give him more power</l>
            <l>Over his tribe, than any fatherhood:</l>
            <l>Nay, all the father in him must plead loud</l>
            <l>For marriage of his daughter where she loved— </l>
            <l>Her love being placed so high and lustrously.</l>
            <l>The Gypsy chieftain had foreseen a price</l>
            <l>That would be paid him for his daughter's dower—</l>
            <l>Might soon give signs. Oh, all his purpose lay </l>
            <l>Face upward. Silva here felt strong, and smiled. </l>
            <l>What could a Spanish noble not command?</l>
            <l>He only helped the Queen, because he chose; </l>
            <l>Could war on Spaniards, and could spare the Moor; </l>
            <l>Buy justice, or defeat it—if he would:</l>
            <l>Was loyal, not from weakness but from strength </l>
            <l>Of high resolve to use his birthright well.</l>
            <l>For nobles too are gods, like Emperors, </l>
            <l>Accept perforce their own divinity,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And wonder at the virtue of their touch,</l>
            <l>Till obstinate resistance shakes their creed, </l>
            <l>Shattering that self whose wholeness is not rounded </l>
            <l>Save in the plastic souls of other men.</l>
            <l>Don Silva had been suckled in that creed </l>
            <l>(A high-taught speculative noble else), </l>
            <l>Held it absurd as foolish argument</l>
            <l>If any failed in deference, was too proud </l>
            <l>Not to be courteous to so poor a knave </l>
            <l>As one who knew not necessary truths</l>
            <l>Of birth and dues of rank; but cross his will, </l>
            <l>The miracle-working will, his rage leaped out </l>
            <l>As by a right divine to rage more fatal</l>
            <l>Than a mere mortal man's. And now that will </l>
            <l>Had met a stronger adversary—strong</l>
            <l>As awful ghosts are whom we cannot touch,</l>
            <l>While they clutch us, subtly as poisoned air, </l>
            <l>In deep-laid fibres of inherited fear</l>
            <l>That lie below all courage.</l>
            <l>Silva said,</l>
            <l>"She is not lost to me, might still be mine </l>
            <l>But for the Inquisition—the dire hand</l>
            <l>That waits to clutch her with a hideous grasp </l>
            <l>Not passionate, human, living, but a grasp</l>
            <l>As in the death-throe when the human soul </l>
            <l>Departs and leaves force unrelenting, locked,</l>
            <l>Not to be loosened save by slow decay</l>
            <l>That frets the universe. Father Isidor </l>
            <l>Has willed it so: his phial dropped the oil</l>
            <l>To catch the air-borne motes of idle slander; </l>
            <l>He fed the fascinated gaze that clung</l>
            <l>Round all her movements, frank as growths of spring, </l>
            <l>With the new hateful interest of suspicion.</l>
            <l>What barrier is this Gypsy? a mere gate </l>
            <l>I'll find the key for. The one barrier,</l>
            <l>The tightening cord that winds about my limbs, </l>
            <l>ls this kind uncle, this imperious saint,</l>
            <l>He who will save me, guard me from myself. </l>
            <l>And he can work his will: I have no help </l>
            <l>Save reptile secrecy, and no revenge</l>
            <l>Save that I will do what he schemes to hinder. </l>
            <l>Ay, secrecy, and disobedience—these</l>
            <l>No tyranny can master. Disobey!</l>
            <l>You may divide the universe with God, </l>
            <l>Keeping your will unbent, and hold a world</l>
            <l>Where He is not supreme. The Prior shall know it!</l>
            <l>His will shall breed resistance: he shall do </l>
            <l>The thing he would not, further what he hates </l>
            <l>By hardening my resolve."</l>
            <l>But 'neath this speech—</l>
            <l>Defiant, hectoring, the more passionate voice </l>
            <l>Of many-blended consciousness—there breathed</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Murmurs of doubt, the weakness of a self </l>
            <l>That is not one; denies and yet believes; </l>
            <l>Protests with passion, "This is natural"— </l>
            <l>Yet owns the other still were truer, better, </l>
            <l>Could nature follow it: a self disturbed</l>
            <l>By budding growths of reason premature</l>
            <l>That breed disease. With all his outflung rage </l>
            <l>Silva half shrank before the steadfast man</l>
            <l>Whose life was one compacted whole, a realm</l>
            <l>Where the rule changed not, and the law was strong. </l>
            <l>Then that reluctant homage stirred new hate,</l>
            <l>And gave rebellion an intenser will.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But soon this inward strife the slow-paced hours </l>
            <l>Slackened; and the soul sank with hunger-pangs, </l>
            <l>Hunger of love. Debate was swept right down </l>
            <l>By certainty of loss intolerable.</l>
            <l>A little loss! only a dark-tressed maid</l>
            <l>Who had no heritage save her beauteous being! </l>
            <l>But in the candour of her virgin eyes</l>
            <l>Saying, I love; and in the mystic charm</l>
            <l>Of her dear presence, Silva found a heaven</l>
            <l>Where faith and hope were drowned as stars in day. </l>
            <l>Fedalma there, each momentary Now</l>
            <l>Seemed a whole blest existence, a full cup </l>
            <l>That, flowing over, asked no pouring hand</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>From past to future. All the world was hers. </l>
            <l>Splendour was but the herald trumpet-note</l>
            <l>Of her imperial coming: penury </l>
            <l>Vanished before her as before a gem,</l>
            <l>The pledge of treasuries. Fedalma there, </l>
            <l>He thought all loveliness was lovelier, </l>
            <l>She crowning it: all goodness credible,</l>
            <l>Because of that great trust her goodness bred. </l>
            <l>For the strong current of the passionate love</l>
            <l>Which urged his life tow'rd hers, like urgent floods </l>
            <l>That hurry through the various-mingled earth, </l>
            <l>Carried within its stream all qualities</l>
            <l>Of what it penetrated, and made love </l>
            <l>Only another name, as Silva was,</l>
            <l>For the whole man that breathed within his frame.</l>
            <l>And she was gone. Well, goddesses will go; </l>
            <l>But for a noble there were mortals left</l>
            <l>Shaped just like goddesses—O hateful sweet!</l>
            <l>O impudent pleasure that should dare to front </l>
            <l>With vulgar visage memories divine!</l>
            <l>The noble's birthright of miraculous will </l>
            <l>Turning I would to must be, spurning all </l>
            <l>Offered as substitute for what it chose, </l>
            <l>Tightened and fixed in strain irrevocable </l>
            <l>The passionate selection of that love</l>
            <l>Which came not first but as all-conquering last.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Great Love has many attributes, and shrines </l>
            <l>For varied worship, but his force divine</l>
            <l>Shows most its many-named fulness in the man </l>
            <l>Whose nature multitudinously mixed—</l>
            <l>Each ardent impulse grappling with a thought— </l>
            <l>Resists all easy gladness, all content</l>
            <l>Save mystic rapture, where the questioning soul </l>
            <l>Flooded with consciousness of good that is </l>
            <l>Finds life one bounteous answer. So it was</l>
            <l>In Silva's nature, Love had mastery there, </l>
            <l>Not as a holiday ruler, but as one</l>
            <l>Who quells a tumult in a day of dread, </l>
            <l>A welcomed despot.</l>
            <l>O all comforters,</l>
            <l>All soothing things that bring mild ecstasy, </l>
            <l>Came with her coming, in her presence lived. </l>
            <l>Spring afternoons, when delicate shadows fall </l>
            <l>Pencilled upon the grass; high summer morns</l>
            <l>When white light rains upon the quiet sea</l>
            <l>And corn-fields flush with ripeness; odours soft— </l>
            <l>Dumb vagrant bliss that seems to seek a home </l>
            <l>And find it deep within, 'mid stirrings vague</l>
            <l>Of far-off moments when our life was fresh; </l>
            <l>All sweetly-tempered music, gentle change </l>
            <l>Of sound, form, colour, as on wide lagoons </l>
            <l>At sunset when from black far-floating prows</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Comes a clear wafted song; all exquisite joy </l>
            <l>Of a subdued desire, like some strong stream </l>
            <l>Made placid in the fulness of a lake—</l>
            <l>All came with her sweet presence, for she brought </l>
            <l>The love supreme which gathers to its realm</l>
            <l>All powers of loving. Subtle nature's hand </l>
            <l>Waked with a touch the far-linked harmonies </l>
            <l>In her own manifold work. Fedalma there, </l>
            <l>Fastidiousness became the prelude fine</l>
            <l>For full contentment; and young melancholy, </l>
            <l>Lost for its origin, seemed but the pain</l>
            <l>Of waiting for that perfect happiness. </l>
            <l>The happiness was gone!</l>
            <l>He sate alone, </l>
            <l>Hating companionship that was not hers;</l>
            <l>Felt bruised with hopeless longing; drank, as wine, </l>
            <l>Illusions of what had been, would have been; </l>
            <l>Weary with anger and a strained resolve,</l>
            <l>Sought passive happiness in waking dreams. </l>
            <l>It has been so with rulers, emperors,</l>
            <l>Nay, sages who held secrets of great Time, </l>
            <l>Sharing his hoary and beneficent life—</l>
            <l>Men who sate throned among the multitudes— </l>
            <l>They have sore sickened at the loss of one.</l>
            <l>Silva sat lonely in her chamber, leaned</l>
            <l>Where she had leaned, to feel the evening breath</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Shed from the orange trees; when suddenly </l>
            <l>His grief was echoed in a sad young voice </l>
            <l>Far and yet near, brought by aërial wings.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The world is great: the birds all fly from me, </l>
            <l>The stars are golden fruit upon a tree</l>
            <l>All out of reach: my little sister went,</l>
            <l>And I am lonely.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The world is great: I tried to mount the hill </l>
            <l>Above the pines, where the light lies so still, </l>
            <l>But it rose higher: little Lisa went,</l>
            <l>And I am lonely.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The world is great: the wind comes rushing by, </l>
            <l>I wonder where it comes from; sea-birds cry </l>
            <l>And hurt my heart: my little sister went,</l>
            <l>And I am lonely.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The world is great: the people laugh and talk, </l>
            <l>And make loud holiday: how fast they walk! </l>
            <l>I'm lame, they push me: little Lisa went,</l>
            <l>And I am lonely.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>'Twas Pablo, like the wounded spirit of song </l>
            <l>Pouring melodious pain to cheat the hour</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>For idle soldiers in the castle court. </l>
            <l>Dreamily Silva heard and hardly felt </l>
            <l>The song was outward, rather felt it part</l>
            <l>Of his own aching, like the lingering day, </l>
            <l>Or slow and mournful cadence of the bell.</l>
            <l>But when the voice had ceased he longed for it, </l>
            <l>And fretted at the pause, as memory frets</l>
            <l>When words that made its body fall away </l>
            <l>And leave it yearning dumbly. Silva then</l>
            <l>Bethought him whence the voice came, framed perforce </l>
            <l>Some outward image of a life not his</l>
            <l>That made a sorrowful centre to the world:</l>
            <l>A boy lame, melancholy-eyed, who bore </l>
            <l>A viol—yes, that very child he saw</l>
            <l>This morning eating roots by the gateway—saw</l>
            <l>As one fresh-ruined sees and spells a name </l>
            <l>And knows not what he does, yet finds it writ </l>
            <l>Full in the inner record. Hark, again!</l>
            <l>The voice and viol. Silva called his thought </l>
            <l>To guide his ear and track the travelling sound.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O bird that used to press</l>
            <l>Thy head against my cheek</l>
            <l>With touch that seemed to speak</l>
            <l>And ask a tender "yes "—</l>
            <l>Ay de mi, my bird!</l>
            <l>O tender downy breast</l>
            <l>And warmly beating heart, </l>
            <l>That beating seemed a part</l>
            <l>Of me who gave it rest—</l>
            <l>Ay de mi, my bird!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The western court! The singer might be seen </l>
            <l>From the upper gallery: quick the Duke was there </l>
            <l>Looking upon the court as on a stage.</l>
            <l>Men eased of armour, stretched upon the ground, </l>
            <l>Gambling by snatches; shepherds from the hills</l>
            <l>Who brought their bleating friends for slaughter; grooms</l>
            <l>Shouldering loose harness; leather-aproned smiths, </l>
            <l>Traders with wares, green-suited serving-men, </l>
            <l>Made a round audience; and in their midst</l>
            <l>Stood little Pablo, pouring forth his song, </l>
            <l>Just as the Duke had pictured. But the song </l>
            <l>Was strangely companied by Roldan's play</l>
            <l>With the swift gleaming balls, and now was crushed </l>
            <l>By peals of laughter at grave Annibal,</l>
            <l>Who carrying stick and purse o'erturned the pence, </l>
            <l>Making mistake by rule. Silva had thought</l>
            <l>To melt hard bitter grief by fellowship </l>
            <l>With the world-sorrow trembling in his ear</l>
            <l>In Pablo's voice; had meant to give command</l>
            <l>For the boy’s presence; but this company,</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>This mountebank and monkey, must be—stay!</l>
            <l>Not be excepted—must be ordered too</l>
            <l>Into his private presence; they had brought</l>
            <l>• Suggestion of a ready shapen tool</l>
            <l>To cut a path between his helpless wish </l>
            <l>And what it imaged. A ready shapen tool! </l>
            <l>A spy, an envoy whom he might despatch </l>
            <l>In unsuspected secrecy, to find</l>
            <l>The Gypsies' refuge so that none beside</l>
            <l>Might learn it. And this juggler could be bribed, </l>
            <l>Would have no fear of Moors—for who would kill </l>
            <l>Dancers and monkeys?—could pretend a journey </l>
            <l>Back to his home, leaving his boy the while</l>
            <l>To please the Duke with song. Without such chance—</l>
            <l>An envoy cheap and secret as a mole</l>
            <l>Who could go scatheless, come back for his pay </l>
            <l>And vanish straight, tied by no neighbourhood— </l>
            <l>Without such chance as this poor juggler brought, </l>
            <l>Finding Fedalma was betraying her.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Short interval betwixt the thought and deed. </l>
            <l>Roldan was called to private audience</l>
            <l>With Annibal and Pablo. All the world</l>
            <l>(By which I mean the score or two who heard) </l>
            <l>Shrugged high their shoulders, and supposed the Duke</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Would fain beguile the evening and replace </l>
            <l>His lacking happiness, as was the right</l>
            <l>Of nobles, who could pay for any cure,</l>
            <l>And wore nought broken, save a broken limb. </l>
            <l>In truth; at first, the Duke bade Pablo sing, </l>
            <l>But, while he sang, called Roldan wide apart, </l>
            <l>And told him of a mission secret, brief</l>
            <l>A quest which well performed might earn much gold, </l>
            <l>But, if betrayed, another sort of pay. </l>
            <l>Roldan was ready; "wished above all for gold </l>
            <l>And never wished to speak; had worked enough </l>
            <l>At wagging his old tongue and chiming jokes; </l>
            <l>Thought it was others' turn to play the fool. </l>
            <l>Give him but pence enough, no rabbit, sirs, </l>
            <l>Would eat and stare and be more dumb than he. </l>
            <l>Give him his orders." </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>They were given straight; </l>
            <l>Gold for the journey, and to buy a mule </l>
            <l>Outside the gates through which he was to pass </l>
            <l>Afoot and carelessly. The boy would stay </l>
            <l>Within the castle, at the Duke's command, </l>
            <l>And must have nought but ignorance to betray </l>
            <l>For threats or coaxing. Once the quest performed, </l>
            <l>The news delivered with some pledge of truth </l>
            <l>Safe to the Duke, the juggler should go forth, </l>
            <l>A fortune in his girdle, take his boy</l>
            <l>And settle firm as any planted tree </l>
            <l>In fair Valencia, never more to roam.</l>
            <l>"Good! good! most worthy of a great hidalgo! </l>
            <l>And Roldan was the man! But Annibal—</l>
            <l>A monkey like no other, though morose </l>
            <l>In private character, yet full of tricks— </l>
            <l>‘Twere hard to carry him, yet harder still </l>
            <l>To leave the boy and him in company </l>
            <l>And free to slip away. The boy was wild</l>
            <l>And shy as mountain kid; once hid himself </l>
            <l>And tried to run away; and Annibal,</l>
            <l>Who always took the lad's side (he was small, </l>
            <l>And they were nearer of a size, and, sirs, </l>
            <l>Your monkey has a spite against us men</l>
            <l>For being bigger)—Annibal went too.</l>

            <l>Both boy and monkey—and 'twas property, </l>
            <l>The trouble he had put in Annibal.</l>
            <l>He didn't choose another man should beat </l>
            <l>His boy and monkey. If they ran away</l>
            <l>Some man would snap them up, and square himself </l>
            <l>And say they were his goods—he'd taught them—no! </l>
            <l>He Roldan had no mind another man</l>
            <l>Should fatten by his monkey, and the boy </l>
            <l>Should not be kicked by any pair of sticks </l>
            <l>Calling himself a juggler."  . . . </l>
            <l>But the Duke,</l>
            <l>Tired of that hammering, signed that it should cease; </l>
            <l>Bade Roldan quit all fears—the boy and ape</l>
            <l>Should be safe lodged in Abderahman's tower, </l>
            <l>In keeping of the great physician there,</l>
            <l>The Duke's most special confidant and friend, </l>
            <l>One skilled in taming brutes, and always kind.</l>
            <l>The Duke himself this eve would see them lodged. </l>
            <l>Roldan must go—spend no more words—but go.</l>

            <l>A room high up in Abderahman's tower, </l>
            <l>A window open to the still warm eve, </l>
            <l>And the bright disc of royal Jupiter.</l>
            <l>Lamps burning low make little atmospheres </l>
            <l>Of light amid the dimness; here and there</l>
            <l>Show books and phials, stones and instruments. </l>
            <l>In carved dark-oaken chair, unpillowed, sleeps </l>
            <l>Right in the rays of Jupiter a small man,</l>
            <l>In skull-cap bordered close with crisp grey curls, </l>
            <l>And loose black gown showing a neck and breast </l>
            <l>Protected by a dim-green amulet;</l>
            <l>Pale-faced, with finest nostril wont to breathe </l>
            <l>Ethereal passion in a world of thought; </l>
            <l>Eyebrows jet-black and firm, yet delicate;</l>
            <l>Beard scant and grizzled; mouth shut firm, with curves </l>
            <l>So subtly turned to meanings exquisite,</l>
            <l>You seem to read them as you read a word </l>
            <l>Full-vowelled, long-descended, pregnant—rich </l>
            <l>With legacies from long, laborious lives.</l>
            <l>Close by him, like a genius of sleep,</l>
            <l>Purrs the grey cat, bridling, with snowy breast. </l>
            <l>A loud knock. "Forward!" in clear vocal ring.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Enter the Duke, Pablo, and Annibal. </l>
            <l>Exit the cat, retreating toward the dark.</l>

            <l>“I know it” still, and soothe the frightened bird</l>
            <l>And feed the child a-hungered, walk abreast</l>
            <l>Of persecuted men, and keep most hate</l>
            <l>For rational torturers. There I stand firm.</l>

            <l>While my heart beats, it shall wear livery—</l>
            <l>My people’s livery, whose yellow badge</l>
            <l>Marks them for Christian scorn. I will not say</l>
            <l>Man is first man to me, then Jew or Gentile:</l>

          <lg>
            <l>A grave task, my lord.</l>
            <l>Have you a shapen purpose, or mere will</l>
            <l>That sees the end alone and not the means?</l>
            <l>Resolve will melt no rocks.</l>

            <l>But it can scale them.</l>
            <l>This fortress has two private issues: one,</l>
            <l>Which served the Gypsies’ flight, to me is closed:</l>
            <l>Our bands must watch the outlet, now betrayed </l>
            <l>To cunning enemies. Remains one other,</l>
            <l>Known to no man save me: a secret left</l>
            <l>As heirloom in our house: a secret safe</l>
            <l>Even from him—from Father Isidor.</l>
            <l>‘Tis he who forces me to use it—he:</l>
            <l>All’s virtue that cheats bloodhounds. Hear, Sephardo.</l>
            <l>Given, my scout returns and brings me news</l>
            <l>I can straight act on, I shall want your aid.</l>
            <l>The issue lies below this tower, your fastness,</l>
            <l>Where, by my charter, you rule absolute.</l>
            <l>I shall feign illness; you with mystic air</l>
            <l>Must speak of treatment asking vigilance</l>
            <l>(Nay I am ill—my life has half ebbed out). </l>
            <l>I shall be whimsical, devolve command </l>
            <l>On Don Diego, speak of poisoning,</l>
            <l>Insist on being lodged within this tower,</l>
            <l>And rid myself of tendance save from you</l>
            <l>And perhaps from Alvar. So I shall escape</l>
            <l>Unseen by spies, shall win the days I need </l>
            <l>To ransom her and have her safe enshrined </l>
            <l>No matter, were my flight disclosed at last:</l>
            <l>I shall come back as from a duel fought</l>
            <l>Which no man can undo. Now you know all.</l>
            <l>Say, can I count on you?</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>For faithfulness</l>
            <l>In aught that I may promise, yes, my lord.</l>
            <l>But—for a pledge of faithfulness—this warning.</l>
            <l>I will betray nought for your personal harm:</l>
            <l>I love you. But note this—I am a Jew;</l>
            <l>And while the Christian persecutes my race,</l>
            <l>I’ll turn at need even the Christian’s trust</l>
            <l>Into a weapon and a shield for Jews.</l>
            <l>Shall Cruelty crowned—wielding the savage force</l>
            <l>Of multitudes, and calling savageness God</l>
            <l>Who gives it victory—upbraid deceit</l>
            <l>And ask for faithfulness? I love you well.</l>
            <l>You are my friend. But yet you are a Christian,</l>
            <l>Whose birth has bound you to the Catholic kings.</l>
            <l>There may come moments when to share my joy</l>
            <l>Would make you a traitor, when to share your grief</l>
            <l>Would make me other than a Jew…</l>

          <lg>
            <l>What need</l>
            <l>To urge that now, Sephardo? I am one</l>
            <l>Of many Spanish nobles who detest</l>
            <l>The roaring bigotry of the herd, would fain</l>
            <l>Dash from the lips of king and queen the cup</l>
            <l>Filled with besotting venom, half infused</l>
            <l>By avarice and half by priests. And now—</l>
            <l>Now when the cruelty you flout me with </l>
            <l>Pierces me too in the apple of my eye,</l>
            <l>Now when my kinship scorches me like hate</l>
            <l>Flashed from a mother’s eye, you choose this time</l>
            <l>To talk of birth as of inherited rage</l>
            <l>Deep-down, volcanic, fatal, bursting forth</l>
            <l>From under hard-taught reason? Wondrous friend!</l>
            <l>My uncle Isidor’s echo, mocking me,</l>
            <l>From the opposing quarter of the heavens,</l>
            <l>With iteration of the thing I know,</l>
            <l>That I’m a Christian knight and Spanish duke!</l>
            <l>The consequence? Why, that I know. It lies</l>
            <l>In my own hands and not on raven tongues.</l>
            <l>The knight and noble shall not wear the chain </l>
            <l>Of false-linked thoughts in brains of other men.</l>
            <l>What question was there ‘twixt us two, of aught</l>
            <l>That makes division? When I come to you</l>
            <l>I come for other doctrine than the Prior’s.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>My lord, you are o’erwrought by pain. My words,</l>
            <l>That carried innocent meaning, do but float</l>
            <l>Like little emptied cups upon the flood</l>
            <l>Your mind brings with it. I but answered you</l>
            <l>With regular proviso, such as stands</l>
            <l>In testaments and charters, to forefend</l>
            <l>A possible case which none deem likelihood;</l>
            <l>Just turned my sleeve, and pointed to the brand</l>
            <l>Of brotherhood that limits every pledge.</l>
            <l>Superfluous nicety—the student’s trick,</l>
            <l>Who will not drink until he can define</l>
            <l>What water is and is not. But enough.</l>
            <l>My will to serve you now knows no division</l>
            <l>Save the alternate beat of love and fear.</l>
            <l>There’s danger in this quest—name, honour, life—</l>
            <l>My lord, the stake is great, and are you sure…</l>
          </lg>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No, I am sure of nought but this Sephardo,</l>
            <l>That I will go. Prudence is but conceit</l>
            <l>Hoodwinked by ignorance. There’s nought exists</l>
            <l>That is not dangerous and holds not death</l>
            <l>For souls or bodies. Prudence turns its helm</l>
            <l>To flee the storm and lands ‘mid pestilence.</l>
            <l>Wisdom would end by throwing dice with folly</l>
            <l>But for dire passion which alone makes choice.</l>
            <l>And I have chosen as the lion robbed</l>
            <l>Chooses to turn upon the ravisher.</l>
            <l>If love were slack, the Prior’s imperious will</l>
            <l>Would move it to outmatch him. But, Sephardo, </l>
            <l>Were all else mute, all passive as sea-calms,</l>
            <l>My soul is one great hunger—I must see her.</l>
            <l>Now you are smiling. Oh, you merciful men</l>
            <l>Pick up coarse griefs and fling them in the face</l>
            <l>Of us whom life with long descent has trained</l>
            <l>To subtler pains, mocking your ready balms.</l>
            <l>You smile at my soul’s hunger.</l>

            <l>And sways our lips in spite of us, my lord,</l>
            <l>When thought weds fact—when maiden prophecy </l>
            <l>Waiting, believing, sees the bridal torch.</l>
            <l>I use not vulgar measures for your grief,</l>
            <l>My pity keeps no cruel feasts; but thought </l>
            <l>Has joys apart, even in blackest woe,</l>
            <l>And seizing some fine threat of verity</l>
            <l>Knows momentary godhead.</l>

            <l>Such chance oft happens, for all characters</l>
            <l>Must shrink or widen, as our wine-skins do,</l>
            <l>For more or less that we can pour in them;</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>True; our growing thought</l>
            <l>Makes growing revelation. But demand not</l>
            <l>Specific augury, as of sure success</l>
            <l>In meditated projects, or of ends</l>
            <l>To be foreknown by peeping in God’s scroll.</l>
            <l>I say—nay, Ptolemy said it, but wise books</l>
            <l>For half the truths they hold are honoured tombs—</l>
            <l>Prediction is contingent of effects</l>
            <l>Where causes and concomitants are mixed</l>
            <l>To seeming wealth of possibilities</l>
            <l>Beyond our reckoning. Who will pretend</l>
            <l>To tell the adventures of each single fish</l>
            <l>Within the Syrian Sea? Show me a fish,</l>
            <l>I’ll weigh him, tell his kind, what he devoured,</l>
            <l>What would have devoured him—but for one Blas</l>
            <l>Who netted him instead; nay, could I tell</l>
            <l>That had Blas missed him, he would not have died</l>
            <l>Of poisonous mud, and so made carrion,</l>
            <l>Swept off at last by some sea-scavenger?</l>

            <l>By how much, then, the fortunes of a man</l>
            <l>Are made of elements refined and mixed</l>
            <l>Beyond a tunny’s, what our science tells of the star’s influence hath contingency</l>
            <l>In special issues. Thus, the loadstone draws,</l>
            <l>Acts like a will to make the iron submiss;</l>
            <l>But garlick rubbing it, that chief effect</l>
            <l>Lies in suspense; the iron keeps at large,</l>
            <l>And garlick is controller of the stone.</l>
            <l>And so, my lord, your horoscope declares</l>
            <l>Not absolutely of your sequent lot,</l>
            <l>But, by our lore’s authentic rules, sets forth</l>
            <l>What gifts, what dispositions, likelihoods</l>
            <l>The aspects of the heavens conspired to fuse</l>
            <l>With your incorporate soul. Aught more than this</l>
            <l>Is vulgar doctrine. For the ambient,</l>
            <l>Though a cause regnant, is not absolute,</l>
            <l>But suffers a determining restraint</l>
            <l>From action of the subject qualities</l>

            <l>Sealed long tradition of the influence shed</l>
            <l>By the heavenly spheres. Here is your horoscope:</l>
            <l>The aspects of the Moon with Mars conjunct,</l>
            <l>Of Venus and the Sun with Saturn, lord</l>

            <l>You spoke as oft you did</l>
            <l>When I was schooling you at Córdova,</l>
            <l>And lessons on the noun and verb were drowned</l>
            <l>With sudden stream of general debate</l>
            <l>On things and actions. Always in that stream</l>
            <l>I saw the play of babbling currents, saw</l>
            <l>A nature o’er-endowed with opposites</l>
            <l>Making a self alternate, where each hour</l>
            <l>Was critic of the last, each mood too strong</l>
            <l>For tolerance of its fellow in close yoke.</l>
            <l>The ardent planets stationed as supreme,</l>
            <l>Potent in action, suffer light malign</l>
            <l>From luminaries large and coldly bright</l>
            <l>Inspiring meditative doubt, which straight</l>
            <l>Doubts of itself, by interposing act</l>
            <l>Of Jupiter in the fourth house fortified</l>
            <l>With power ancestral. So, my lord, I read</l>
            <l>The changeless in in the changing; so I read</l>
            <l>The constant action of celestial powers</l>
            <l>Mixed into waywardness of mortal men,</l>
            <l>Whereof no sage’s eye can trace the course</l>

            <l>Your rashness vindicates itself too much,</l>

            <l>Resolve with you is a fire-breathing steed,</l>

            <l>Which is but iteration of myself,</l>
            <l>And give me promise. Shall I count on you</l>
            <l>To act upon my signal? Kings of Spain</l>
            <l>Like me have found their refuge in a Jew,</l>

            <l>Thus writes our poet Jehuda. I will act</l>

            <l>“Your Israel is nought,” and make my deeds</l>
            <l>The mud they fling upon my brethren.</l>
            <l>I will not fail you, save—you know the terms:</l>
            <l>I am a Jew, and not that infamous life</l>
            <l>That takes on bastardy, will know no father,</l>
            <l>So shrouds itself in the pale abstract, Man.</l>

            <l>The Unnameable made not the search for truth</l>
            <l>To suit hidalgos’ temper. I abide</l>
            <l>By that wise spirit of listening reverence</l>
            <l>Which marks the boldest doctors of our race.</l>
            <l>For Truth, to us, is like a living child</l>
            <l>Born of two parents: if the parents part</l>
            <l>And will divide the child, how shall it live?</l>
            <l>Or, I will rather say: Two angels guide</l>
            <l>The path of man, both aged and yet young, </l>
            <l>As angels are, ripening through endless years.</l>
            <l>On one he leans: some call her Memory,</l>
            <l>And some, Tradition; and her voice is sweet,</l>
            <l>With deep mysterious accords: the other,</l>
            <l>Floating above, holds down a lamp which streams</l>
            <l>A light divine and searching on the earth,</l>
            <l>Compelling eyes and footsteps. Memory yields,</l>
            <l>Yet clings with loving check, and shines anew </l>
            <l>Reflecting all the rays of that bright lamp</l>
            <l>Our angel Reason holds. We had not walked </l>
            <l>But for Tradition; we walk evermore</l>
            <l>To higher paths, by brightening Reason’s lamp.</l>
            <l>Still we are purblind, tottering. I hold less </l>
            <l>Than Aben-Ezra, of that aged lore</l>
            <l>Brought by long centuries from Chaldæan plains;</l>
            <l>The Jew-taught Florentine rejects it all.</l>
            <l>For still the light is measured by the eye,</l>
            <l>And the weak organ fails. I may see ill;</l>
            <l>But over all belief is faithfulness,</l>
            <l>Which fulfils vision with obedience.</l>
            <l>So, I must grasp my morsels: truth is oft</l>
            <l>Scattered in fragments round a stately pile</l>
            <l>Built half of error; and the eye’s defect</l>
            <l>May breed too much denial. But, my lord,</l>
            <l>I weary your sick soul. Go now with me</l>
            <l>Into the turret. We will watch the spheres,</l>
            <l>And see the constellations bend and plunge</l>
            <l>Into a depth of being where our eyes </l>
            <l>Hold them no more. We’ll quit ourselves and be</l>
            <l>The red Aldebaran or bright Sirius,</l>
            <l>And sail as in a solemn voyage, bound</l>

            <l>they are with the highest fitness so called who are</l>
            <l>noble by ancient lineage, and lead a worthy life as</l>
            <l>by inheritance from afar; and hence are more bound</l>
            <l>and constrained to act well, and guard themselves</l>
            <l>from error and wrong-doing; for in their case it is</l>
            <l>more true that by evil-doing they bring injury and</l>

            <l>The court and nobles are retiring now</l>

            <l>Good day, my mistress. How’s your merchandise?</l>
            <l>Fit for a host to buy? Your apples now,</l>
            <l>They have fair cheeks; how are they at the core?</l>

            <l>Good, good, sir! Taste and try. See, here is one</l>
            <l>Weighs a man’s head. The best are bound with tow:</l>
            <l>They’re worth the pains, to keep the peel from splits.</l>
            <l>(She takes out an apple bound with tow, and, as</l>

            <l>Ay, give it me, </l>
            <l>I’ll take it to the Doctor in the tower. </l>
            <l>He feeds on fruit, and if he likes the sort </l>

            <l>A LETTER.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>“Zarca, the chieftain of the Gypsies, greets</l>
            <l>“The King El Zagal. Let the force be sent</l>
            <l>“With utmost swiftness to the Pass of Luz.</l>
            <l>“A good five hundred added to my bands</l>
            <l>“Will master all the garrison: the town</l>
            <l>“Is half with us, and will not lift an arm</l>
            <l>“Save on our side. My scouts have found a way</l>
            <l>“Where once we thought the fortress most secure:</l>
            <l>“Spying a man upon the height, they traced,</l>
            <l>“By keen conjecture piecing broken sight,</l>
            <l>“His downward path, and found its issue. There</l>
            <l>“A file of us can mount, surprise the fort</l>
            <l>“And give the signal to our friends within </l>
            <l>“To ope the gates for our confederate bands,</l>
            <l>“Who will lie eastward ambushed by the rocks,</l>
            <l>“Waiting the night. Enough; give me command,</l>
            <l>“Bedmár is yours. Chief Zarca will redeem</l>
            <l>“His pledge of highest service to the Moor:</l>
            <l>“Let the Moor too be faithful and repay</l>
            <l>“The Gypsy with the furtherance he needs</l>
            <l>“To lead his people over Bahr el Scham</l>
            <l>“And plant them on the shore of Africa.</l>
            <l>“So may the King El Zagal live as one </l>
            <l>“Who, trusting Allah will be true to him,</l>
            <l>“Maketh himself as Allah true to friends.”</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>QUIT now the town, and with a journeying dream</l>
            <l>Swift as the wings of sound yet seeming slow</l>
            <l>Through multitudinous pulsing of stored sense</l>
            <l>And spiritual space, see walls and towers</l>
            <l>Lie in the silent whiteness of a trance,</l>
            <l>Giving no sign of that warm life within</l>
            <l>That moves and murmurs through their hidden heart.</l>
            <l>Pass o’er the mountain, wind in sombre shade,</l>
            <l>Then wind into the light and see the town</l>
            <l>Shrunk to white crust upon the darker rock.</l>
            <l>Turn east and south, descend, then rise anew</l>
            <l>‘Mid smaller mountains ebbing towards the plain:</l>
            <l>Scent the fresh breath of the height-loving herbs</l>
            <l>That, trodden by the pretty parted hoofs</l>
            <l>Of nimble goats, sigh at the innocent bruise,</l>
            <l>And with a mingled difference exquisite</l>
            <l>Pour a sweet burthen on the buoyant air.</l>
            <l>Pause now and be all ear. Far from the south,</l>
            <l>Seeking the listening silence of the heights,</l>
            <l>Comes a slow-dying sound—the Moslem’s call</l>
            <l>To prayer in afternoon. Bright in the sun</l>
            <l>Like tall white sails on a green shadowy sea</l>
            <l>Stand Moorish watch-towers: ‘neath that eastern sky</l>
            <l>Couches unseen the strength of Moorish Baza;</l>
            <l>Where the meridian bends lies Guadix, hold</l>
            <l>Of brave El Zagal. This is Moorish land, </l>
            <l>Where Allah lives unconquered in dark breasts</l>
            <l>And blesses still the many-nourishing earth</l>
            <l>With dark-armed industry. See from the steep</l>
            <l>The scattered olives hurry in grey throngs</l>
            <l>Down towards the valley, where the little stream</l>
            <l>Parts a green hollow ‘twixt the gentler slopes; </l>
            <l>And in that hollow, dwellings: not white homes</l>
            <l>Of building Moors, but little swarthy tents</l>
            <l>Such as of old perhaps on Asian plains,</l>
            <l>Or wending westward past the Caucasus,</l>
            <l>Our fathers raised to rest in. Close they swarm</l>
            <l>About two taller tents, and viewed afar</l>
            <l>Might seem a dark-robed crowd in penitence</l>
            <l>That silent kneel; but come now in their midst</l>
            <l>And watch a busy, bright-eyed, sportive life!</l>
            <l>Tall maidens bend to feed the tethered goat,</l>
            <l>The ragged kirtle fringing at the knee</l>
            <l>Above the living curves, the shoulder’s smoothness</l>
            <l>Parting the torrent strong of ebon hair.</l>
            <l>Women with babes, the wild and neural glance</l>
            <l>Swayed now to sweet desire of mothers’ eyes,</l>
            <l>Rock their strong cradling arms and chant low</l>
            <l>strains</l>
            <l>Taught by monotonous and soothing winds</l>
            <l>That fall at night-time on the dozing ear.</l>
            <l>The crones plait reeds, or shred the vivid herbs</l>
            <l>Into the cauldron: tiny urchins crawl</l>
            <l>Or sit and gurgle forth their infant joy.</l>
            <l>Lads lying sphinx-like with uplifted breast</l>
            <l>Propped on their elbows, their black manes tossed</l>
            <l>back,</l>
            <l>Fling up the coin and watch its fatal fall,</l>
            <l>Dispute and scramble, run and wrestle fierce,</l>
            <l>Then fall to play and fellowship again;</l>
            <l>Or in a thieving swarm they run to plague</l>
            <l>The grandsires, who return with rabbits slung,</l>
            <l>And with the mules fruit-laden from the fields.</l>
            <l>Some striplings choose the smooth stones from the </l>
            <l>brook</l>
            <l>To serve the slingers, cut the twigs for snares,</l>
            <l>Or trim the hazel-wands, or at the bark</l>
            <l>Of some exploring dog they dart away</l>
            <l>With swift precision towards a moving speck.</l>
            <l>These are the brood of Zarca’s Gypsy tribe;</l>
            <l>Most like an earth-born race bred by the Sun</l>
            <l>On some rich tropic soil, the father’s light</l>
            <l>Flashing in coal-black eyes, the mother’s blood</l>
            <l>With bounteous elements feeding their young limbs.</l>
            <l>The stalwart men and youths are at the wars</l>
            <l>Following their chief, all save a trusty band</l>
            <l>Who keep strict watch along the northern heights.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But see, upon a pleasant spot removed</l>
            <l>From the camp’s hubbub, where the thicket strong</l>
            <l>Of huge-eared cactus makes a bordering curve </l>
            <l>And casts a shadow, lies a sleeping man</l>
            <l>With Spanish hat screening his upturned face,</l>
            <l>His doublet loose, his right arm backward flung,</l>
            <l>His left caressing close the long-necked lute</l>
            <l>That seems to sleep too, leaning tow’rds its lord.</l>
            <l>He draws deep breath secure but not unwatched.</l>
            <l>Moving a-tiptoe, silent as the elves,</l>
            <l>As mischievous too, trip three bare-footed girls</l>
            <l>Not opened yet to womanhood—dark flowers</l>
            <l>In slim long buds: some paces farther off</l>
            <l>Gathers a little white-teethed shaggy group,</l>
            <l>A grinning chorus to the merry play.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The tripping girls have robbed the sleeping man</l>
            <l>Of all his ornaments. Hita is decked</l>
            <l>With an embroidered scarf across her rags;</l>
            <l>Tralla, with thorns for pins, sticks two rosettes</l>
            <l>Upon her threadbare woollen; Hinda now, </l>
            <l>Prettiest and boldest, tucks her kirtle up</l>
            <l>As wallet for the stolen buttons—then </l>
            <l>Bends with her knife to cut from off the hat</l>
            <l>The aigrette and long feather; deftly cuts,</l>
            <l>Yet wakes the sleeper, who with a sudden start</l>
            <l>Shakes off the masking hat and shows the face</l>
            <l>Of Juan: Hinda swift as thought leaps back,</l>
            <l>But carries off the spoil triumphantly,</l>
            <l>And leads the chorus of a happy laugh,</l>
            <l>Running with all the naked-footed imps,</l>
            <l>Till with safe survey all can face about</l>
            <l>And watch for signs of stimulating chase,</l>
            <l>While Hinda ties long grass around her brow</l>
            <l>To stick the feather in with majesty.</l>
            <l>Juan still sits contemplative, with looks</l>
            <l>Alternate at the spoilers and their work.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, you marauding kite—my feather gone!</l>
            <l>My belt, my scarf, my buttons and rosettes!</l>
            <l>This is to be a brother of your tribe!</l>
            <l>The fiery-blooded children of the Sun—</l>
            <l>So says chief Zarca—children of the Sun!</l>
            <l>Ay, ay, the black and stinging flies he breeds</l>
            <l>To plague the decent body of mankind.</l>
            <l>“Orpheus, professor of the gai saber,</l>
            <l>Made all the brutes polite by dint of song.”</l>
            <l>Pregnant—but as a guide in daily life</l>
            <l>Delusive. For if song and music cure</l>
            <l>The barbarous trick of thieving, ‘tis a cure</l>
            <l>That works as slowly as old Doctor Time</l>
            <l>In curing folly. Why, the minxes there</l>
            <l>Have rhythm in their toes, and music rings</l>
            <l>As readily from them as from little bells</l>
            <l>Swung by the breeze. Well, I will try the physic.</l>
            <l>(He touches his lute.)</l>
            <l>Hem! taken rightly, any single thing,</l>
            <l>The Rabbis say, implies all other things.</l>
            <l>A knotty task, though, the unravelling</l>
            <l>Meum and Tuum from a saraband:</l>
            <l>It needs a subtle logic, nay, perhaps</l>
            <l>A good large property, to see the thread.</l>
            <l>(He touches the lute again.)</l>
            <l>There’s more of odd than even in this world.</l>
            <l>Else pretty sinners would not be let off</l>
            <l>Sooner than ugly; for if honeycombs</l>
            <l>Are to be got by stealing, they should go</l>
            <l>Where life is bitterest on the tongue. And yet—</l>
            <l>Because this minx has pretty ways I wink</l>
            <l>At all her tricks, though if a flat-faced lass,</l>
            <l>With eyes askew, were half as bold as she,</l>
            <l>I should chastise her with a hazel switch.</l>
            <l>I’m a plucked peacock—even my voice and wit </l>
            <l>Without a tail!—why, any fool detects</l>
            <l>The absence of your tail, but twenty fools</l>
            <l>May not detect the presence of your wit.</l>
            <l>(He touches his lute again.)</l>
            <l>Well, I must coax my tail back cunningly,</l>
            <l>For to run after these brown lizards—ah!</l>
            <l>I think the lizards lift their ears at this.</l>
            <l>(As he thrums his lute the lads and girls grad-</l>
            <l>ually approach: he touches it more briskly,</l>
            <l>and HINDA, advancing, begins to move arms </l>
            <l>and legs with an initiatory dancing move-</l>
            <l>ment, smiling coaxingly at JUAN. He sud-</l>
            <l>denly stops, lays down his lute and folds his</l>
            <l>arms.)</l>

          </lg>

            <l>What, you expect a tune to dance to, eh?</l>

          <lg>
            <l>But that is what you cannot have, my sweet</l>
            <l>brothers and sisters. The tunes are all dead—dead</l>
            <l>as the tunes of the lark when you have plucked his</l>
            <l>wings off; dead as the song of the grasshopper when</l>
            <l>the ass has swallowed him. I can play and sing no</l>
            <l>more. Hinda has killed my tunes.</l>
            <l>(All cry out in consternation. HINDA gives a </l>
            <l>wail and tries to examine the lute.)</l>

            <l>Understand, Señora Hinda, that the tunes are in</l>
            <l>me; they are not in the lute till I put them there.</l>
            <l>And if you cross my humour, I shall be as tuneless</l>
            <l>as a bag of wool. If the tunes are to be brought to</l>
            <l>life again, I must have my feather back.</l>
            <l>(HINDA kisses his hands and feet coaxingly.)</l>
            <l>No, no! not a note will come for coaxing. The</l>
            <l>feather, I say, the feather!</l>
            <l>(HINDA sorrowfully takes off the feather, and</l>
            <l>gives it to JUAN.)</l>
            <l>Ah, now let us see. Perhaps a tune will come.</l>
            <l>(He plays a measure, and the three girls begin</l>
            <l>to dance; then he suddenly stops.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No, the tune will not come: it wants the aigrette</l>
            <l>(pointing to it on Hinda’s neck).</l>
            <l>(HINDA, with rather less hesitation, but again</l>
            <l>sorrowfully, takes off the aigrette, and gives</l>
            <l>it to him.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ha! (He plays again, but, after rather a longer time,</l>
            <l>again stops.) No, no; ‘tis the buttons are wanting,</l>
            <l>Hinda, the buttons. This tune feeds chiefly on but-</l>
            <l>tons—a greedy tune. It wants one, two, three, four,</l>
            <l>five, six. Good!</l>
            <l>(After HINDA has given up the buttons, and</l>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker> has laid them down one by one, he</l>
            <l>begins to play again, going on longer than </l>
            <l>before, so that the dancers become excited</l>
            <l>by the movement. Then he stops.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Ah, Hita, it is the belt, and, Tralla, the rosettes—</l>
            <l>both are wanting. I see the tune will not go on</l>
            <l>without them.</l>
            <l>(HITA and TRALLA take off the belt and rosettes,</l>
            <l>and lay them down quickly, being fired by the</l>
            <l>dancing, and eager for the music. All the</l>
            <l>articles lie by JUAN’s side on the ground.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Good, good, my docile wild-cats! Now I think</l>
            <l>the tunes are all alive again. Now you may dance</l>
            <l>and sing too. Hinda, my little screamer, lead off</l>
            <l>with the song I taught you, and let us see if the</l>
            <l>tune will go right on from beginning to end.</l>
            <l>(He plays. The dance begins again, HINDA </l>
            <l>singing. All the other boys and girls join</l>
            <l>in the chorus, and all at last dance wildly.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>SONG.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>All things journey: sun and moon,</l>
            <l>Morning, noon, and afternoon,</l>
            <l>Night and all her stars:</l>
            <l>‘Twixt the east and western bars</l>
            <l>Round they journey,</l>
            <l>Come and go!</l>
            <l>We go with them!</l>
            <l>For to roam and ever roam</l>
            <l>Is the Zincali’s loved home.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Earth is good, the hillside breaks</l>
            <l>By the ashen roots and makes</l>
            <l>Hungry nostrils glad:</l>
            <l>Then we run till we are mad,</l>
            <l>Like the horses,</l>
            <l>And we cry,</l>
            <l>None shall catch us!</l>
            <l>Swift wings wing us—we are free—</l>
            <l>Drink the air—we Zincali!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Falls the snow: the pine-branch split,</l>
            <l>Call the fire out, see it flit,</l>
            <l>Through the dry leaves run,</l>
            <l>Spread and glow, and make a sun</l>
            <l>In the dark tent:</l>
            <l>O warm dark!</l>
            <l>Warm as conies!</l>
            <l>Strong fire loves us, we are warm!</l>
            <l>Who the Zincali shall harm?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Onward journey: fires are spent;</l>
            <l>Sunward, sunward! lift the tent,</l>
            <l>Run before the rain,</l>
            <l>Through the pass, along the plain.</l>
            <l>Hurry, hurry,</l>
            <l>Lift us, wind!</l>
            <l>Like the horses.</l>
            <l>For to roam and ever roam</l>
            <l>Is the Zincali’s loved home.</l>
            <l>(When the dance is at its height, HINDA breaks</l>
            <l>away from the rest, and dances round JUAN,</l>
            <l>who is now standing. As he turns a little</l>
            <l>to watch her movement, some of the boys skip </l>
            <l>towards the feather, aigrette, , snatch</l>
            <l>them up, and run away, swiftly followed </l>
            <l>by HITA, TRALLA, and the rest. HINDA,</l>
            <l>as she turns again, sees them, screams, and </l>
            <l>falls in her whirling; but immediately gets </l>
            <l>up, and rushes after them, still screaming</l>
            <l>with rage.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Santiago! these imps get bolder. Haha! Señora</l>
            <l>Hinda, this finishes your lesson in ethics. You have</l>
            <l>seen the advantage of giving up stolen goods. Now</l>
            <l>you see the ugliness of thieving when practiced by</l>
            <l>others. That fable of mine about the tunes was </l>
            <l>excellently devised. I feel like an ancient sage in-</l>
            <l>structing our lisping ancestors. My memory will</l>
            <l>descend as the Orpheus of Gypsies. But I must</l>
            <l>prepare a rod for those rascals. I’ll bastinado them</l>
            <l>with prickly pears. It seems to me these needles</l>
            <l>will have a sound moral teaching in them.</l>
            <l>(While JUAN takes a knife from his belt, and</l>
            <l>surveys a bush of the prickly pear, HINDA</l>
            <l>returns.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Pray, Señora, why do you fume? Did you want</l>
            <l>To steal my ornaments again yourself?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>HINDA</speaker> (sobbing).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No; I thought you would give them me back </l>
            <l>again.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>What, did you want the tunes to die again? Do</l>
            <l>you like finery better than dancing?</l>

          <lg>
            <l><speaker>HINDA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Oh, that was a tale! I shall tell tales too, when</l>
            <l>I want to get anything I can’t steal. And I know</l>
            <l>what I will do. I shall tell the boys I’ve found some </l>
            <l>little foxes, and I will never say where they are till </l>
            <l>they give me back the feather!</l>
            <l>(She runs off again.)</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Hem! the disciple seems to seize the mode sooner</l>
            <l>than the matter. Teaching virtue with this prickly</l>
            <l>pear may only teach the youngsters to use a new</l>
            <l>weapon; as your teaching orthodoxy with faggots</l>
            <l>may only bring up a fashion of roasting. Dios! my </l>
            <l>remarks grow too pregnant—my wits get a plethora</l>
            <l>by solitary feeding on the produce of my own</l>
            <l>wisdom. </l>
            <l>(As he puts up his knife again, HINDA comes</l>
            <l>running back, and crying, “Our Queen!</l>
            <l>our Queen!” JUAN adjusts his garments</l>
            <l>and his lute, while HINDA turns to meet </l>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>, who wears a Moorish dress,</l>
            <l>her black hair hanging round her in</l>
            <l>plaits, a white turban on her head, a</l>
            <l>dagger by her side. She carries a scarf </l>
            <l>on her left arm, which she holds up as </l>
            <l>a shade.)</l>
          </lg>

            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (patting HINDA’s head).</l>

          <lg>
            <l>How now, wild one? You are hot and panting.</l>
            <l>Go to my tent, and help Nouna to plait reeds.</l>
            <l>(HINDA kisses FEDALMA’s hand, and runs off.</l>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> advances towards JUAN, who</l>
            <l>kneels to take up the edge of her cymar,</l>
            <l>and kisses it.)</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>How is it with you, lady? You look sad.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Oh, I am sick at heart. The eye of day,</l>
            <l>The insistent summer sun, seems pitiless,</l>
            <l>Shining in all the barren crevices</l>
            <l>Of weary life, leaving no shade, no dark,</l>
            <l>Where I may dream that hidden waters lie;</l>
            <l>As pitiless as to some shipwrecked man,</l>
            <l>Who gazing from his narrow shoal of sand</l>
            <l>On the wide unspecked round of blue and blue </l>
            <l>Sees that full light is errorless despair.</l>
            <l>The insects’ hum that slurs the silent dark</l>
            <l>Startles and seems to cheat me, as the tread</l>
            <l>Of coming footsteps cheats the midnight watcher</l>
            <l>Who holds her heart and waits to hear them pause, </l>
            <l>And hears them never pause, but pass and die.</l>
            <l>Music sweeps by me as a messenger</l>
            <l>Carrying a message that is not for me.</l>
            <l>The very sameness of the hills and sky</l>
            <l>Is obduracy, and the lingering hours</l>
            <l>Wait round me dumbly, like superfluous slaves,</l>
            <l>Of whom I want nought but the secret news</l>
            <l>They are forbid to tell. And, Juan, you—</l>
            <l>You, too, are cruel—would be over-wise</l>
            <l>In judging your friend’s needs, and choose to hide</l>
            <l>Something I crave to know.</l>

            <l>I never had the virtue to hide aught,</l>
            <l>Save what a man is whipped for publishing.</l>
            <l>I’m no more reticent than the voluble air—</l>
            <l>Dote on disclosure—never could contain</l>
            <l>The latter half of all my sentences, </l>
            <l>But for the need to utter the beginning.</l>
            <l>My lust to tell is so importunate</l>
            <l>That it abridges every other vice,</l>
            <l>And makes me temperate for want of time.</l>
            <l>I dull sensation in the haste to say</l>
            <l>‘Tis this or that, and choke report with surmise.</l>

            <l>By speech that gravely seems to ask belief.</l>
            <l>You are but babbling in a part you play</l>

            <l>Lies from Bedmár—what mountains lie between—</l>
            <l>Could tell me if you would about the Duke—</l>

            <l>The thread Fedalma made in that rich web,</l>
            <l>A Spanish noble’s life. No, that is false!</l>

            <l>Some evil has befallen him—he’s slain—</l>
            <l>Has sought for danger and has beckoned death</l>

            <l>Masked cunningly to look like royal truth</l>

            <l>Or else some image of reality</l>
            <l>That doubt will handle and reject as false.</l>
            <l>As for conjecture—I can thread the sky </l>
            <l>Like any swallow, but, if you insist</l>
            <l>On knowledge that would guide a pair of feet</l>
            <l>Right to Bedmár, across the Moorish bounds,</l>
            <l>A mule that dreams of stumbling over stones</l>

            <l>Rumours kept from me by my father?</l>

            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>None.</l>
            <l>Your father trusts no secret to the echoes.</l>
            <l>Of late his movements have been hid from all</l>
            <l>Save those few hundred chosen Gypsy breasts</l>
            <l>He carries with him. Think you he’s a man</l>
            <l>To let his projects slip from out his belt,</l>
            <l>Then whisper him to haps to find them strayed</l>
            <l>To be so kind as keep his counsel well?</l>
            <l>Why, if he found me knowing aught too much,</l>
            <l>He would straight gag or strangle me, and say,</l>
            <l>“Poor hound! it was a pity that his bark</l>
            <l>Could chance to mar my plans: he loved my</l>
            <l>daughter—</l>
            <l>The idle hound had nought to do but love,</l>
            <l>So followed to the battle and got crushed.”</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Good Juan, I could have no nobler friend.</l>
            <l>You’d ope your veins and let your life-blood out</l>
            <l>To save another’s pain, yet hide the deed</l>
            <l>With jesting—say, ‘twas merest accident,</l>
            <l>A sportive scratch that went by chance too deep—</l>
            <l>And die content with men’s slight thoughts of you,</l>
            <l>Finding your glory in another’s joy.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Dub not my liking virtues, lest they get</l>
            <l>A drug-like taste, and breed a nausea.</l>
            <l>Honey’s not sweet, commended as cathartic.</l>
            <l>Such names are parchment labels upon gems</l>
            <l>Hiding their color. What is lovely seen</l>
            <l>Priced in a tarif?—lapis lazuli,</l>
            <l>Such bulk, so many drachmas: amethysts</l>
            <l>Quoted at so much; sapphires higher still.</l>
            <l>The stone like soldi heaven in its blueness</l>
            <l>Is what I care for, not its name or price.</l>
            <l>So, if I live or die to serve my friend, </l>
            <l>‘Tis for my love—‘tis for my friend alone,</l>
            <l>And not for any rate that friendship bears</l>
            <l>In heaven or on earth. Nay, I romance—</l>
            <l>I talk of Roland and the ancient peers.</l>
            <l>In me ‘tis hardly friendship, only lack</l>
            <l>Of a substantial self that holds a weight;</l>
            <l>So I kiss larger things and roll with them.</l>

            <l>Oh, you will never hide your soul from me;</l>
            <l>I’ve seen the jewel’s flash, and know ‘tis there,</l>
            <l>Muffle it as you will. That foam-like talk</l>
            <l>Will not wash out a fear which blots the good</l>
            <l>Your presence brings me. Oft I’m pierced afresh</l>
            <l>Through all the pressure of my selfish griefs</l>
            <l>By thought of you. It was a rash resolve</l>
            <l>Made you disclose yourself when you kept watch</l>
            <l>About the terrace wall:—your pity leaped,</l>
            <l>Seeing alone my ills and not your loss,</l>
            <l>Self-doomed to exile. Juan, you must repent.</l>
            <l>‘Tis not in nature that resolve, which feeds </l>
            <l>On strenuous actions, should not pine and die</l>
            <l>In these long days of empty listlessness.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Repent? Not I. Repentance is the weight</l>
            <l>Of indigested meals ta’en yesterday.</l>
            <l>‘Tis for large animals that gorge on prey,</l>
            <l>Not for a honey-sipping butterfly.</l>
            <l>I am a thing of rhythm and redondillas—</l>
            <l>The momentary rainbow on the spray</l>
            <l>Made by the thundering torrent of men’s lives:</l>
            <l>No matter whether I am here or there;</l>
            <l>I still catch sunbeams. And in Africa,</l>
            <l>Where melons and all fruits, they say, grow large,</l>
            <l>Fables are real, and the apes polite,</l>
            <l>A poet, too, may prosper past belief:</l>
            <l>I shall grow epic, like Florentine,</l>
            <l>And sing the founding of our infant state,</l>
            <l>Sing the new Gypsy Carthage.</l>

            <l>Africa</l>
            <l>Would we were there! Under another heaven,</l>
            <l>In lands were neither love nor memory</l>
            <l>Can plant a selfish hope—in lands so far</l>
            <l>I should not seem to see the outstretched arms </l>
            <l>That seek me, or to hear the voice that calls.</l>
            <l>I should feel distance only and despair;</l>
            <l>So rest for ever from the thought of bliss,</l>
            <l>And wear my weight of life’s great chain unstruggling.</l>
            <l>Juan, if I could know he would forget—</l>
            <l>Nay, not forget, forgive me—he content</l>
            <l>That I forsook him for no joy, but sorrow,</l>
            <l>For sorrow chosen rather than a joy</l>
            <l>That destiny made base! Then he would taste</l>
            <l>No bitterness in sweet, sad memory,</l>
            <l>And I should live unblemished in his thought,</l>
            <l>Hallowed like her who dies an unwed bride.</l>
            <l>Our words have wings, but fly not where we would.</l>
            <l>Could mine but reach him, Juan!</l>

            <l>My feet have wings—I’ll be your Mercury.</l>
            <l>I fear no shadowed perils by the way. </l>
            <l>No man will wear the sharpness of his sword </l>
            <l>On me. Nay, I’m a herald of the Muse,</l>
            <l>Sacred for Moors and Spaniards. I will go—</l>
            <l>Will fetch you tidings for an amulet.</l>
            <l>But stretch not hope too strongly towards that mark</l>
            <l>As issue of my wandering. Given, I cross</l>
            <l>Safely the Moorish border, reach Bedmár:</l>
            <l>Fresh counsels may prevail there, and the Duke</l>
            <l>Being absent in the field, I may be trapped.</l>
            <l>Men who are sour at missing larger game</l>
            <l>May wing a chattering sparrow for revenge.</l>
            <l>It is a chance no further worth the note</l>
            <l>Than as a warning, lest you feared worse ill</l>
            <l>If my return were stayed. I might be caged;</l>
            <l>They would not harm me else. Untimely death,</l>
            <l>The red auxiliary of the skeleton,</l>
            <l>Has too much work on hand to think of me;</l>
            <l>Or, if he cares to slay me, I shall fall</l>
            <l>Choked with a grape-stone for economy.</l>
            <l>The likelier chance is that I go and come,</l>
            <l>Bringing you comfort back.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>No, Juan, no!</l>
            <l>Those yearning words came from a soul infirm,</l>
            <l>Crying and struggling at the pain of bonds</l>
            <l>Which yet it would not loosen. He knows all—</l>
            <l>All that he needs to know: I said farewell:</l>
            <l>I stepped across the cracking earth and knew</l>
            <l>‘Twould yawn behind me. I must walk right on.</l>
            <l>No, I will not win aught by risking you:</l>
            <l>That risk would poison my poor hope. Besides,</l>
            <l>‘Twere treachery in me: my father wills</l>
            <l>That we—all here—should rest within this camp.</l>
            <l>If I can never live, like him, on faith</l>
            <l>In glorious marrows, I am resolute.</l>
            <l>While he treads painfully with stillest step</l>
            <l>And beady brow, pressed ‘neath the weight of arms,</l>
            <l>Shall I, to ease my fevered restlessness,</l>
            <l>Raise peevish moans, shattering that fragile silence?</l>
            <l>No! On the close-thronged spaces of the earth</l>
            <l>A battle rages: Fate has carried me</l>
            <l>‘Mid the thick arrows: I will keep my stand—</l>

            <l>The thing I have to do. But you, dear Juan,</l>

            <l>Shows like a roadside bush culled of its buds.</l>
            <l>Yet, if your graciousness will not disdain</l>
            <l>A poor plucked songster—shall he sing to you?</l>
            <l>Some lay of afternoons—some ballad strain</l>

            <l>Yet welcome, too. Straightaway she rose and stood,</l>
            <l>All languor banished, with a soul suspense,</l>

            <l>It was himself!</l>
            <l>She saw him now advancing, girt with arms</l>
            <l>That seemed like idle trophies hung for show</l>
            <l>Beside the weight and fire of living strength</l>
            <l>That made his frame. He glanced with absent tri-</l>
            <l>umph,</l>
            <l>As one who conquers in some field afar</l>

            <l>Grappling for life with Christians who lay waste</l>
            <l>Granáda’s valleys, and with devilish hoofs</l>
            <l>Trample the young green corn, with devilish play</l>
            <l>Fell blossomed trees, and tear up well-pruned vines:</l>
            <l>Cruel as tigers to the vanquished brave,</l>
            <l>They wring our gold by oaths they mean to break;</l>
            <l>Take pay for pity and are pitiless;</l>
            <l>Then tinkle bells above the desolate earth</l>
            <l>And praise their monstrous gods, supposed to love</l>
            <l>The flattery of liars. I will strike</l>
            <l>The full-gorged dragon. You, my child, must watch</l>
            <l>The battle with a heart, not fluttering</l>
            <l>But duteous, firm-weighted by resolve,</l>
            <l>Choosing between two lives, like her who holds</l>
            <l>A dagger which must pierce one of two breasts,</l>
            <l>And one of them her father’s. You divine—</l>

            <l>You will not falter, not look back and long</l>
            <l>For unfledged ease in some soft alien nest.</l>

            <l>If it were needed, this poor trembling hand</l>

            <l>From such poor doubleness. The life we choose</l>

            <l>I think no evil—am not angry, child.</l>
            <l>But would you part from Ismaël? leave him now</l>
            <l>If your chief bade you—said it was for good</l>
            <l>To all your tribe that you must part from him?</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Nay, child, answer me.</l>
            <l>Could you leave Ismaël? get into a boat</l>
            <l>And see the waters widen ‘twixt you two</l>
            <l>Till all was water and you saw him not,</l>
            <l>And knew that you would never see him more?</l>
            <l>If ‘twas your chief’s command, and if he said</l>
            <l>Your tribe would all be slaughtered, die of plague,</l>
            <l>Of famine—madly drink each other’s blood…</l>

            <l>O Queen, if it is so, tell Ismaël.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>You would obey, then? part from him for ever?</l>

            <l>How could we live else? With our brethren lost?—</l>
            <l>No marriage feast? The day would turn to dark.</l>
            <l>A Zincala cannot live without her tribe.</l>
            <l>I must obey! Poor Ismaël—poor Hinda!</l>
            <l>But will it ever be so cold and dark?</l>
            <l>Oh, I would sit upon the rocks and cry,</l>
            <l>And cry so long that I could cry no more:</l>
            <l>Then I should go to sleep.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>No, Hinda, no!</l>
            <l>Thou never shalt be called to part from him.</l>
            <l>I will have berries for thee, red and black,</l>
            <l>And I will be so glad to see thee glad,</l>
            <l>That earth will seem to hold enough of joy</l>
            <l>To outweigh all the pangs of those who part.</l>
            <l>Be comforted, bright eyes. See, I will tie</l>
            <l>These roses in a crown, for thee to wear.</l>

          <lg>
            <l>Oh, I’m as glad as many little foxes—</l>
            <l>I will find Ismaël, and tell him all.</l>

            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker> (alone).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>She has the strength I lack. Within her world</l>
            <l>The dial has not stirred since first she woke:</l>
            <l>No changing light has made the shadows die,</l>
            <l>And taught her trusting soul sad difference.</l>
            <l>For her, good, right, and law are all summed up</l>
            <l>In what is possible: life is one web</l>
            <l>Where love, joy, kindred, and obedience</l>
            <l>Lie fast and even, in one warp and woof</l>
            <l>With thirst and drinking, hunger, food, and sleep.</l>
            <l>She knows no struggles, sees no double path:</l>
            <l>Her fate is freedom, for her will is one </l>
            <l>With her own people’s law, the only law</l>
            <l>She ever knew. For me—I have fire within,</l>
            <l>But on my will there falls the chilling snow</l>
            <l>Of thoughts that come as subtly as soft flakes,</l>
            <l>Yet press at last with hard and icy weight.</l>
            <l>I could be firm, could give myself the wrench</l>
            <l>And walk erect, hiding my life-long wound,</l>
            <l>If I but saw the fruit of all my pain</l>
            <l>With that strong vision which commands the soul,</l>
            <l>And makes great awe the monarch of desire.</l>
            <l>But now I totter, seeing no far goal:</l>
            <l>I tread the rocky pass, and pause and grasp,</l>
            <l>Guided by flashes. When my father comes,</l>
            <l>And breathes into my soul his generous hope—</l>
            <l>By his own greatness making life seem great,</l>
            <l>As the clear heavens bring sublimity,</l>
            <l>And show earth larger, spanned by that blue vast—</l>
            <l>Resolve is strong: I can embrace my sorrow,</l>
            <l>Nor nicely weigh the fruit; possessed with need</l>
            <l>Solely to do the noblest, though it failed—</l>
            <l>Though lava streamed upon my breathing deed</l>
            <l>And buried it in night and barrenness.</l>
            <l>But soon the glow dies out, the trumpet strain</l>
            <l>That vibrated as strength through all my limbs</l>
            <l>Is heard no longer; over the wide scene</l>
            <l>There’s nought but chill grey silence, or the hum</l>
            <l>And fitful discord of a vulgar world.</l>
            <l>Then I sink helpless—sink into the arms</l>
            <l>Of all sweet memories, and dream of bliss:</l>
            <l>See looks that penetrate like tones; hear tones</l>
            <l>That flash looks with them. Even now I feel</l>
            <l>Soft airs enwrap me, as if yearning rays</l>
            <l>Of some far presence touched me with their warmth</l>
            <l>And brought a tender murmuring…</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[While she mused,</l>
            <l>A figure came from out the olive trees</l>
            <l>That bent close-whispering ‘twixt the parted hills</l>
            <l>Beyond the crescent of thick cactus: paused</l>
            <l>At sight of her; then slowly forward moved </l>
            <l>With careful steps, and gently said, “FEDALMA!”</l>
            <l>Fearing lest fancy had enslaved her sense,</l>
            <l>She quivered, rose, but turned not. Soon again:</l>
            <l>“FEDALMA, it is SILVA!” Then she turned.</l>
            <l>He, with bared head and arms entreating, beamed</l>
            <l>Like morning on her. Vision held her still</l>
            <l>On moment, then with gliding motion swift,</l>
            <l>Inevitable as the melting stream’s,</l>
            <l>She found her rest within his circling arms.]</l>

            <l>Once more we are together. Wishing dies—</l>

          <lg>
            <l>You did not hate me, then—</l>
            <l>Think me an ingrate—think my love was small</l>
            <l>That I forsook you?</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Dear, I trusted you</l>
            <l>As holy men trust God. You could do nought</l>
            <l>That was not pure and loving—though the deed</l>
            <l>Might pierce me unto death. You had less trust,</l>
            <l>Since you suspected mine. ‘Twas wicked doubt.</l>

          </lg>

            <l>Nay, when I saw you hating me, the fault</l>
            <l>Seemed in my lot—my bitter birthright—hers</l>
            <l>On whom you lavished all your wealth of love</l>
            <l>As price of nought but sorrow. Then I said,</l>
            <l>“’Tis better so. He will be happier!”</l>
            <l>But soon that thought, struggling to be a hope,</l>
            <l>Would end in tears.</l>

            <l>Chief, I have brought no scorn to meet your scorn.</l>
            <l>I came because love urged me—that deep love</l>
            <l>I bear to her whom you call daughter—her </l>
            <l>Whom I reclaim as my betrothed bride.</l>

            <l>I came alone. The only force I bring</l>
            <l>Is tenderness. Nay, I will trust besides </l>
            <l>In all the pleadings of a father’s care</l>
            <l>To wed his daughter as her nature bids.</l>
            <l>And for your tribe—whatever purposed good</l>
            <l>Your thoughts may cherish, I will make secure</l>
            <l>With the strong surety of a noble’s power:</l>

            <l>Your love’s beseeching will be force supreme.</l>
            <l>She will go with you as a willing slave,</l>
            <l>Will give a word of parting to her father,</l>
            <l>Wave farewells to her tribe, then turn and say,</l>

            <l>Ay,</l>
            <l>Such love is common: I have seen it oft—</l>
            <l>Seen many women rend the sacred ties</l>
            <l>That bind them in high fellowship with men,</l>
            <l>Making them mothers of a people’s virtue:</l>
            <l>Seen them so levelled to a handsome steed</l>
            <l>That yesterday was Moorish property,</l>
            <l>To-day is Christian—wears new-fashioned gear,</l>
            <l>Neighs to new feeders, and will prance alike</l>
            <l>Under all banners, so the banner be</l>
            <l>A master’s who caresses. Such light change</l>
            <l>You call conversion; but we Zincali call</l>
            <l>Conversion infamy. Our people’s faith</l>
            <l>Is faithfulness; not the rote-learned belief</l>
            <l>That we are heaven’s highest favourites,</l>
            <l>But the resolve that being most forsaken</l>
            <l>Among the sons of men, we will be true</l>
            <l>Each to the other, and our common lot.</l>
            <l>You Christians burn men for their heresy:</l>
            <l>Our vilest heretic is that Zincala</l>
            <l>Who, choosing ease, forsakes her people’s woes.</l>
            <l>The dowry of my daughter is to be</l>
            <l>Chief woman of her tribe, and rescue it.</l>
            <l>A bride with such a dowry has no match</l>
            <l>Among the subjects of that Catholic Queen</l>
            <l>Who would have Gypsies swept into the sea</l>

            <l>Will sacrifice your daughter—to no god,</l>
            <l>But to a ravenous fire within your soul,</l>
            <l>Mad hopes, blind hate, that like possessing fiends</l>
            <l>Shriek at a name! This sweetest virgin, reared </l>
            <l>As garden flowers, to give the sordid world</l>
            <l>Glimpses of perfectness, you snatch and thrust</l>
            <l>On dreary wilds; in visions mad, proclaim</l>
            <l>Semiramis of Gypsy wanderers;</l>
            <l>Doom, with a broken arrow in her heart,</l>
            <l>To wait for death ‘mid squalid savages:</l>
            <l>For what? You would be saviour of your tribe;</l>
            <l>So said Fedalma’s letter; rather say,</l>
            <l>You have the will to save by ruling men,</l>
            <l>But first to rule; and with that flinty will</l>
            <l>You cut your way, though the first cut you give</l>
            <l>Gash your child’s bosom.</l>
            <l>(While <speaker>DON SILVA</speaker>.has been speaking, with</l>

            <l>You only are the reasonable man;</l>
            <l>You have a heart, I none. Fedalma’s good</l>
            <l>Is what you see, you care for; while I seek</l>
            <l>No good, not even my own, urged on by nought</l>
            <l>But hellish hunger, which must still be fed</l>
            <l>Though in the feeding it I suffer throes.</l>
            <l>Fume at your own opinion as you will:</l>
            <l>I speak not now to you, but to my daughter.</l>
            <l>If she still calls it good to mate with you,</l>
            <l>To be a Spanish duchess, kneel at court,</l>
            <l>And hope her beauty is excuse to men</l>
            <l>When women whisper, “A mere Zincala!”</l>
            <l>If she still calls it good to take a lot</l>
            <l>That measures joy for her as she forgets</l>
            <l>Her kindred and her kindred’s misery,</l>
            <l>Nor feels the softness of her downy couch</l>
            <l>Marred by remembrance that she once forsook</l>
            <l>The place that she was born to—let her go!</l>
            <l>If life for her still lies in alien love,</l>
            <l>That forces her to shut her soul from truth</l>
            <l>As men in shameful pleasures shut out day;</l>
            <l>And death, for her, is to do rarest deeds,</l>
            <l>Which even failing, leave new faith to men,</l>
            <l>The faith in human hearts—then, let her go!</l>
            <l>She is my only offspring; in her veins</l>
            <l>She bears the blood her tribe has trusted in;</l>
            <l>Her heritage is their obedience,</l>
            <l>And if I died, she might still lead them forth</l>
            <l>To plant the race her lover now reviles</l>
            <l>Where they may make a nation, and may rise</l>
            <l>To grander manhood than his race can show;</l>
            <l>Then live a goddess, sanctifying oaths,</l>
            <l>Enforcing right, and ruling consciences,</l>
            <l>By law deep-graven in exalting deeds,</l>
            <l>Through the long ages of her people’s life.</l>
            <l>If she can leave that lot for silken shame,</l>
            <l>For kisses honeyed by oblivion—</l>
            <l>The bliss of drunkards or the blank of fools—</l>
            <l>Then let her go! You Spanish Catholics,</l>
            <l>When you are cruel, base, and treacherous,</l>
            <l>For ends not pious, tender gifts to God,</l>
            <l>And for men’s wounds offer much oil to churches:</l>
            <l>We have no altars for such healing gifts </l>
            <l>As soothe the heavens for outrage done on earth.</l>
            <l>We have no priesthood and no creed to teach</l>
            <l>That she—the Zincala—who might save her race</l>
            <l>And yet abandons it, may cleanse that blot,</l>
            <l>And mend the curse her life has been to men,</l>
            <l>By saving her own soul. Her one base choice</l>
            <l>Is wrong unchangeable, is poison shed</l>
            <l>Where men must drink, shed by her poisoning will.</l>
            <l>Now choose, Fedalma!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[But her choice was made.</l>
            <l>Slowly, while yet her father spoke, she moved</l>
            <l>From where oblique with deprecating arms</l>
            <l>She stood between the two who swayed her heart:</l>
            <l>Slowly she moved to choose sublime pain;</l>
            <l>Yearning, yet shrinking; wrought upon by awe,</l>
            <l>Her own brief life seeming a little isle</l>
            <l>Remote through visions of a wider world</l>
            <l>With fates close-crowded; firm to slay her joy</l>
            <l>That cut her heart with smiles beneath the knife,</l>
            <l>Like a sweet babe foredoomed by prophecy.</l>
            <l>She stood apart, yet near her father: stood</l>
            <l>Hand clutching hand, her limbs all tense with will</l>
            <l>That strove ‘gainst anguish, eyes that seemed a soul</l>
            <l>Yearning in death towards him she loved and left.</l>
            <l>He faced her, pale with passion and a will</l>
            <l>Fierce to resist whatever might seem strong</l>
            <l>And ask him to submit: he saw one end—</l>
            <l>He must be conqueror; monarch of his lot</l>
            <l>And not its tributary. But she spoke</l>

            <l>An unknown need stirred darkly in my soul,</l>
            <l>And made me restless even in my bliss.</l>
            <l>Oh, all my bliss was in our love; but now</l>

            <l>My lord Duke,</l>
            <l>I have been patient, given room for speech,</l>
            <l>Bent not to remove my daughter by command,</l>
            <l>Save that of her own faithfulness. But now,</l>
            <l>All further words are idle elegies</l>
            <l>Unfitting times of action. You are here</l>
            <l>With the safe-conduct of that trust you showed</l>
            <l>Coming unguarded to the Gypsy’s camp.</l>
            <l>I would fain meet all trust with courtesy</l>
            <l>As well as honour; but my utmost power</l>
            <l>Is to afford you Gypsy guard to-night</l>
            <l>Within the tents that keep the northward lines,</l>
            <l>And for the morrow, escort on your way</l>
            <l>Back to the Moorish bounds.</l>

            <l>What if my words</l>
            <l>Were meant for deeds, decisive as a leap</l>
            <l>Into the current? It is not my wont</l>
            <l>To utter hollow words, and speak resolves</l>
            <l>Like verses bandied in a madrigal.</l>
            <l>I spoke in action first: I faced all risks</l>
            <l>To find Fedalma. Action speaks again</l>
            <l>When I, a Spanish noble, here declare</l>
            <l>That I abide with her, adopt her lot,</l>
            <l>Claiming alone fulfillment of her vows</l>
            <l>As my betrothed wife.</l>

            <l>That you will claim my daughter is to say </l>
            <l>That you will leave your Spanish dignities,</l>
            <l>Your home, your wealth, your people, to become</l>
            <l>Wholly a Zincalo: share our wanderings,</l>
            <l>And be a match meet for my daughter’s dower</l>
            <l>By living for her tribe; take the deep oath</l>

            <l>To work the will of a more tyrannous friend</l>

            <l>Gives choice of ills; forces me to defy,</l>
            <l>But shall not force me to a weak defiance.</l>
            <l>The power that threatened you, to master me,</l>

            <l>Your father has a chieftain’s ends, befitting</l>

            <l>For when your father speaks, I shall hear you.</l>
            <l>Life were no gain if you were lost to me:</l>
            <l>I would straight go and seek the Moorish walls,</l>

            <l>The Glorious Mother and her pitying Son</l>

            <l>Perhaps they hate their cruel worshippers,</l>

            <l>They love you and have sent me to defend you.</l>

            <l>Now twice the day had sunk from off the hills</l>
            <l>While Silva kept his watch there, with the band </l>
            <l>Of stalwart Gypsies. When the sun was high</l>
            <l>He slept; then, waking, strained impatient eyes</l>
            <l>To catch the promise of some moving form</l>
            <l>That might be Juan—Juan who went and came</l>
            <l>To soothe two hearts, and claimed nought for his own:</l>
            <l>Friend more divine than all divinities,</l>
            <l>Quenching his human thirst in others’ joy.</l>
            <l>All through the lingering nights and pale chill dawns</l>
            <l>Juan had hovered near; with delicate sense,</l>
            <l>As of some breath from every changing mood,</l>
            <l>Had spoken or kept silence; touched his lute</l>
            <l>To hint of melody, or poured brief strains</l>
            <l>That seemed to make all sorrows natural,</l>
            <l>Hardly worth weeping for, since life was short,</l>
            <l>And shared by loving souls. Such pity welled</l>
            <l>Within the minstrel’s heart of light-tongued Juan</l>
            <l>For this doomed man, who with dream-shrouded eyes</l>
            <l>Had stepped into a torrent as a brook,</l>
            <l>Thinking to ford it and return at will,</l>
            <l>And now waked helpless in the eddying flood,</l>
            <l>Hemmed by its raging hurry. Once that thought,</l>
            <l>How easy wandering is, how hard and strict </l>
            <l>The homeward way, had slipped from reverie</l>
            <l>Into low-murmured song;—(brief Spanish song</l>
            <l>‘Scaped him as sighs escape from other men).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Push off the boat,</l>
            <l>Quit, quit the shore,</l>
            <l>The stars will guide us back:—</l>
            <l>O gathering cloud,</l>
            <l>O wide, wide sea,</l>
            <l>O waves that keep no track!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>On through the pines!</l>
            <l>The pillared woods,</l>
            <l>Where silence breathes sweet breath:—</l>
            <l>O labyrinth,</l>
            <l>O sunless gloom,</l>
            <l>The other side of death!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Such plaintive song had seemed to please the Duke—</l>
            <l>Had seemed to melt all voices of reproach</l>
            <l>To sympathetic sadness; but his moods</l>
            <l>Had grown more fitful with the growing hours,</l>
            <l>And this soft murmur had the iterant voice</l>
            <l>Of heartless Echo, whom no pain can move</l>
            <l>To say aught else than we have said to her.</l>
            <l>He spoke, impatient: “Juan, cease thy song.</l>
            <l>Our whimpering poesy and small-paced tunes</l>
            <l>Have no more utterance than the cricket’s chirp</l>
            <l>For souls that carry heaven and hell within.”</l>
            <l>Then Juan, lightly: “True, my lord, I chirp</l>
            <l>For lack of soul; some hungry poets chirp</l>
            <l>For lack of bread. ‘Twere wiser to sit down</l>
            <l>And count the star-seed, till I fell asleep</l>
            <l>With the cheap wine of pure stupidity.”</l>
            <l>And Silva, checked by courtesy: “Nay, Juan,</l>
            <l>Were speech once good, thy song were best of speech.</l>
            <l>I meant, all life is but poor mockery:</l>
            <l>Action, place, power, the visible wide world</l>
            <l>Are tattered masquerading of this self,</l>
            <l>This pulse of conscious mystery: all change,</l>
            <l>Whether to high or low, is change of rags.</l>
            <l>But for her love, I would not take a good</l>
            <l>Save to burn out in battle, in a flame</l>
            <l>Of madness that would feel no mangled limbs,</l>
            <l>And die not knowing death, but passing straight</l>
            <l>—Well, well, to other flames—in purgatory.”</l>
            <l>Keen Juan’s ear caught the self-discontent</l>
            <l>That vibrated beneath the changing tones</l>
            <l>Of life-contemning scorn. Gently he said:</l>
            <l>“But with her love, my lord, the world deserves</l>
            <l>A higher rate; were it but masquerade,</l>
            <l>The rags were surely worth the wearing?” “Yes.</l>
            <l>No misery shall force me to repent</l>
            <l>That I have loved her.”</l>
            <l>So with wilful talk,</l>
            <l>Fencing the wounded soul from beating winds</l>
            <l>Of truth that came unasked, companionship</l>
            <l>Made the hours lighter. And the Gypsy guard,</l>
            <l>Trusting familiar Juan, were content,</l>
            <l>At friendly hint from him, to still their songs</l>
            <l>And busy jargon round the nightly fires.</l>
            <l>Such sounds, the quick-conceiving poet knew</l>
            <l>Would strike on Silva’s agitated soul</l>
            <l>Like mocking repetition of the oath</l>
            <l>That bound him in strange clanship with the tribe</l>
            <l>Of human panthers, flame-eyed, lithe-limbed, fierce,</l>
            <l>Unrecking of time-woven subtleties</l>
            <l>And high tribunals of a phantom-world.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But the third day, though Silva southward gazed</l>
            <l>Till all the shadows slanted towards him, gazed</l>
            <l>Till all the shadows died, no Juan came.</l>
            <l>Now in his stead came loneliness, and Thought</l>
            <l>Inexorable, fastening with firm chain</l>
            <l>What is to what hath been. Now awful Night,</l>
            <l>The prime ancestral mystery, came down</l>
            <l>Past all the generations of the stars,</l>
            <l>And visited his soul with touch more close</l>
            <l>Than when he kept that younger, briefer watch</l>
            <l>Under the church’s roof beside his arms,</l>
            <l>And won his knighthood.</l>
            <l>Well, this solitude,</l>
            <l>This company with the enduring universe,</l>
            <l>Whose mighty silence carrying all the past</l>
            <l>Absorbs our history as with a breath,</l>
            <l>Should give him more assurance, make him strong</l>
            <l>In all contempt of that poor circumstance</l>
            <l>Called human life—customs and bonds and laws</l>
            <l>Wherewith men make a better or a worse,</l>
            <l>Like children playing on a barren mount</l>
            <l>Feigning a thing to strive for or avoid.</l>
            <l>Thus Silva argued with his many-voiced self,</l>
            <l>Whose thwarted needs, like angry multitudes,</l>
            <l>Lured from the home that nurtured them to strength,</l>
            <l>Made loud insurgence. Thus he called on Thought,</l>
            <l>On dexterous Thought, with its swift alchemy</l>
            <l>To change all forms, dissolve all prejudice</l>
            <l>Of man’s long heritage, and yield him up</l>
            <l>A crude fused world to fashion as he would.</l>
            <l>Thought played him double; seemed to wear the </l>
            <l>yoke</l>
            <l>Of sovereign passion in the noon-day height</l>
            <l>Of passion’s prevalence; but served anon</l>
            <l>As tribune to the larger soul which brought </l>
            <l>Loud-mingled cries from every human need</l>
            <l>That ages had instructed into life.</l>
            <l>He could not grasp Night’s black blank mystery </l>
            <l>And wear it for a spiritual garb</l>
            <l>Creed-proof: he shuddered at its passionless touch.</l>
            <l>On solitary souls, the universe </l>
            <l>Looks down inhospitable; the human heart</l>
            <l>Finds nowhere shelter but in human kind.</l>
            <l>He yearned towards images that had breath in them,</l>
            <l>That sprang warm palpitant with memories</l>
            <l>From streets and altars, from ancestral homes</l>
            <l>Banners and trophies and the cherishing rays</l>
            <l>Of shame and honour in the eyes of man.</l>
            <l>These made the speech articulate of his soul,</l>
            <l>That could not move to utterance of scorn</l>
            <l>Save in words bred by fellowship; could not feel</l>
            <l>Resolve of hardest constancy to love</l>
            <l>The firmer for the sorrows of the loved,</l>
            <l>Save by concurrent energies high wrought</l>
            <l>To sensibilities transcending sense</l>
            <l>Through close community, and long-shared pains</l>
            <l>Of far-off generations. All in vain</l>
            <l>He sought the outlaw’s strength, and made a right</l>
            <l>Contemning that hereditary right</l>
            <l>Which held dim habitations in his frame, </l>
            <l>Mysterious haunts of echoes old and far,</l>
            <l>The voice divine of human loyalty.</l>
            <l>At home, among his people, he had played</l>
            <l>In sceptic ease with saints and litanies,</l>
            <l>And thunders of the Church that deadened fell</l>
            <l>Through screens of priests plethoric. Awe, unscathed</l>
            <l>By deeper trespass, slept without a dream.</l>
            <l>But for such trespass as made outcasts, still</l>
            <l>The ancient Furies lived with faces new</l>
            <l>And lurked with lighter slumber than of old</l>
            <l>O’er Catholic Spain, the land of sacred oaths</l>
            <l>That might be broken.</l>
            <l>Now the former life</l>
            <l>Of close-linked fellowship, the life that made</l>
            <l>His full-formed self, as the impregnate sap</l>
            <l>Of years successive frames the full-branched tree—</l>
            <l>Was present in one whole; and that great trust</l>
            <l>His deed had broken turned reproach on him</l>
            <l>From faces of all witnesses who heard</l>
            <l>His uttered pledges; saw him hold high place</l>
            <l>Centring reliance; use rich privilege</l>
            <l>That bound him like a victim-nourished god</l>
            <l>By tacit covenant to shield and bless;</l>
            <l>Assume the Cross and take his knightly oath</l>
            <l>Mature, deliberate: faces human all, </l>
            <l>And some divine as well as human: His</l>
            <l>Who hung supreme, the suffering Man divine</l>
            <l>Above the altar; Hers, the Mother pure</l>
            <l>Whose glance informed his masculine tenderness</l>
            <l>With deepest reverence; the Archangel armed,</l>
            <l>Trampling man’s enemy: all heroic forms</l>
            <l>That fill the world of faith with voices, hearts,</l>
            <l>And high companionship, to Silva now</l>
            <l>Made but one inward and insistent world</l>
            <l>With faces of his peers, with court and hall</l>
            <l>And deference, and reverent vassalage,</l>
            <l>And filial pieties—one current strong,</l>
            <l>The warmly mingled life-blood of his mind,</l>
            <l>Sustaining him even when he idly played</l>
            <l>With rules, beliefs, charges, and ceremonies</l>
            <l>As arbitrary fooling. Such revenge </l>
            <l>Is wrought by the long travail of mankind</l>
            <l>On him who scorns it, and would shape his life </l>
            <l>Without obedience.</l>
            <l>But his warrior’s pride</l>
            <l>Would take no wounds save on the breast. He faced</l>
            <l>The fatal crowd: “I never shall repent!</l>
            <l>If I have sinned, my sin was made for me</l>
            <l>By men’s perverseness. There’s no blameless life</l>
            <l>Save for the passionless, no sanctities</l>
            <l>But have the self-same roof and props with crime,</l>
            <l>Or have their roots close interlaced with wrong.</l>
            <l>If I had loved her less, been more a craven,</l>
            <l>I had kept my place and won the easy praise</l>
            <l>Of a true Spanish noble. But I loved,</l>
            <l>And, loving, dared—not Death the warrior</l>
            <l>But Infamy that binds and strips, and holds</l>
            <l>The brand and lash. I have dared all for her.</l>
            <l>She was my good—what other men call heaven,</l>
            <l>And for the sake of it bear penances;</l>
            <l>Nay, some of old were baited, tortured, flayed</l>
            <l>To win their heaven. Heaven was their good,</l>
            <l>She, mine. And I have braved for her all fires</l>
            <l>Certain or threatened; for I go away</l>
            <l>Beyond the reach of expiation—far away </l>
            <l>From sacramental blessing. Does God bless</l>
            <l>No outlaw? Shut his absolution fast</l>
            <l>In human breath? Is there no God for me</l>
            <l>Save him whose cross I have forsaken?—Well,</l>
            <l>I am for ever exiled—but with her!</l>
            <l>She is dragged out into the wilderness;</l>
            <l>I, with my love, will be her providence.</l>
            <l>I have a right to choose my good or ill,</l>
            <l>A right to damn myself! The ill is mine.</l>
            <l>I never will repent!”…</l>
            <l>Thus Silva, inwardly debating, all his ear</l>
            <l>Turned into audience of twofold mind;</l>
            <l>For even in tumult full-fraught consciousness</l>
            <l>Had plenteous being for a self aloof</l>
            <l>That gazed and listened, like a soul in dreams</l>
            <l>Weaving the wondrous tale it marvels at.</l>
            <l>But oft the conflict slackened, oft strong Love</l>
            <l>With tidal energy returning laid</l>
            <l>All other restlessness: Fedalma came,</l>
            <l>And with her visionary presence brought</l>
            <l>What seemed a waking in the warm spring morn.</l>
            <l>He still was pacing on the stony earth</l>
            <l>Under the deepening night; the fresh-lit fires</l>
            <l>Were flickering on dark forms and eyes that met</l>
            <l>His forward and his backward tread; but she,</l>
            <l>She was within him, making his whole self</l>
            <l>Mere correspondence with her image: sense,</l>
            <l>In all its deep recesses where it keeps</l>
            <l>The mystic stores of ecstasy, was turned</l>
            <l>To memory that killed the hour, like wine.</l>
            <l>Then Silva said, “She, by herself, is life.</l>
            <l>What was my joy before I loved her—what</l>
            <l>Shall heaven lure us with, love being lost?”—</l>
            <l>For he was young.</l>
            <l>But now around the fires</l>
            <l>The Gypsy band felt freer; Juan’s song</l>
            <l>Was no more there, nor Juan’s friendly ways</l>
            <l>For links of amity ‘twixt their wild mood</l>
            <l>And this strange brother, this pale Spanish duke,</l>
            <l>Who with their Gypsy badge upon his breast</l>
            <l>Took readier place within their alien hearts</l>
            <l>As a marked captive, who would fain escape.</l>
            <l>And Nadar, who commanded them, had known</l>
            <l>The prison in Bedmár. So now, in talk</l>
            <l>Foreign to Spanish ears, they said their minds,</l>
            <l>Discussed their chief’s intent, the lot marked out</l>
            <l>For this new brother. Would he wed their queen?</l>
            <l>And some denied, saying their queen would wed</l>
            <l>Only a Gypsy duke—one who would join</l>
            <l>Their bands in Telemsán. But others thought</l>
            <l>Young Hassan was to wed her; said their chief</l>
            <l>Would never trust this noble of Castile,</l>
            <l>Who in his very swearing was forsworn.</l>
            <l>And then one fell to chanting, in wild notes</l>
            <l>Recurrent like the moan of outshut winds,</l>
            <l>The adjuration they were wont to use</l>
            <l>To any Spaniard who would join their tribe:</l>
            <l>Words of plain Spanish, lately stirred anew</l>
            <l>And ready at new impulse. Soon the rest,</l>
            <l>Drawn to the stream of sound, made unison</l>
            <l>Higher and lower, till the tidal sweep</l>
            <l>Seemed to assail the Duke and close him round </l>
            <l>With force dæmonic. All debate till now</l>
            <l>Had wrestled with the urgence of that oath</l>
            <l>Already broken; now the newer oath</l>
            <l>Thrust its loud presence on him. He stood still,</l>
            <l>Close baited by loud-barking thoughts—fierce hounds</l>
            <l>Of that Supreme, the irreversible Past.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The ZINCALI sing.</l>
            <l>Brother, hear and take the curse,</l>
            <l>Curse of soul’s and body’s throes,</l>
            <l>If you hate not all our foes,</l>
            <l>Cling not fast to all our woes,</l>
            <l>Turn false Zincalo!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>May you be accurst </l>
            <l>By hunger and by thirst</l>
            <l>By spiked pangs,</l>
            <l>Starvation’s fangs</l>
            <l>Clutching you alone </l>
            <l>When none but peering vultures hear your moan.</l>
            <l>Curst by burning hands,</l>
            <l>Curst by aching brow,</l>
            <l>When on sea-wide sands</l>
            <l>Fever lays you low;</l>
            <l>By the maddened brain</l>
            <l>When the running water glistens,</l>
            <l>And the deaf ear listens, listens,</l>
            <l>Prisoned fire within the vein,</l>
            <l>On the tongue and on the lip</l>
            <l>Not a sip</l>
            <l>From the earth or skies;</l>
            <l>Hot the desert lies</l>
            <l>Pressed into your anguish,</l>
            <l>Narrowing earth and narrowing sky</l>
            <l>Into lonely misery.</l>
            <l>Lonely may you languish</l>
            <l>Through the day and through the night,</l>
            <l>Hate the darkness, hate the light,</l>
            <l>Pray and find no ear,</l>
            <l>Feel no brother near,</l>
            <l>Till on death you cry,</l>
            <l>Death who passes by,</l>
            <l>And anew you groan,</l>
            <l>Scaring the vultures all to leave you living lone:</l>
            <l>Curst by soul’s and body’s throes</l>
            <l>If you love the dark men’s foes,</l>
            <l>Cling not fast to all the dark men’s woes,</l>
            <l>Turn false Zincalo! </l>
            <l>Swear to hate the cruel cross,</l>
            <l>The silver cross!</l>
            <l>Glittering, laughing at the blood</l>
            <l>Shed below it in a flood</l>
            <l>When it glitters over Moorish porches;</l>
            <l>Laughing at the scent flesh</l>
            <l>When it glitters where the faggot scorches,</l>
            <l>Burning life’s mysterious mesh:</l>
            <l>Blood of wandering Israël,</l>
            <l>Blood of wandering Ismaël,</l>
            <l>Blood, the drink of Christian scorn,</l>
            <l>Blood of wanderers, sons of morn</l>
            <l>Where the life of men began:</l>
            <l>Swear to hate the cross!—</l>
            <l>Sign of all the wanderer’s foes,</l>
            <l>Sign of all the wanderer’s woes—</l>
            <l>Else its curse light on you!</l>
            <l>Else the curse upon you light</l>
            <l>Of its sharp red-sworded might.</l>
            <l>May it lie a blood-red blight</l>
            <l>On all things within your sight:</l>
            <l>On the white haze of the morn,</l>
            <l>On the meadows and the corn,</l>
            <l>On the sun and on the moon,</l>
            <l>On the clearness of the noon,</l>
            <l>On the darkness of the night.</l>
            <l>May it fill your aching sight—</l>
            <l>Red-cross sword and sword blood-red—</l>
            <l>Till it press upon your head,</l>
            <l>Till it lie within your brain,</l>
            <l>Piercing sharp, a cross of pain,</l>
            <l>Till it lie upon your heart,</l>
            <l>Burning hot, a cross of fire,</l>
            <l>Till from sense in every part</l>
            <l>Pains have clustered like a stinging swarm</l>
            <l>In the cross’s form,</l>
            <l>And you see nought but the cross of blood,</l>
            <l>And you feel nought but the cross of fire:</l>
            <l>Curst by all the cross’s throes</l>
            <l>If you hate not all our foes,</l>
            <l>Cling not fast to all our woes,</l>
            <l>Turn false Zincalo!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A fierce delight was in the Gypsies’ chant:</l>
            <l>They thought no more of Silva, only felt</l>
            <l>Like those broad-chested rovers of the night</l>
            <l>Who pour exuberant strength upon the air.</l>
            <l>To him it seemed as if the hellish rhythm, </l>
            <l>Resolving in long curves that slackened now, </l>
            <l>Now hurried, sweeping round again to slackness,</l>
            <l>Would cease no more. What use to raise his voice,</l>
            <l>Or grasp his weapon? He was powerless now,</l>
            <l>With these new comrades of his future—he </l>
            <l>Who had been wont to have his wishes feared</l>
            <l>And guessed at as a hidden law for men.</l>
            <l>Even the passive silence of the night</l>
            <l>That left these howlers mastery, even the moon,</l>
            <l>Rising and staring with a helpless face,</l>
            <l>Angered him. He was ready now to fly</l>
            <l>At some loud throat, and give the signal so</l>
            <l>For butchery of himself.</l>
            <l>But suddenly</l>
            <l>The sounds that travelled towards no foreseen close</l>
            <l>Were torn right off and fringed into the night;</l>
            <l>Sharp Gypsy ears had caught the onward strain</l>
            <l>Of kindred voices joining in the chant.</l>
            <l>All started to their feet and mustered close,</l>
            <l>Auguring long-waited summons. It was come:</l>
            <l>The summons to set forth and join their chief.</l>
            <l>Fedalma had been called, and she was gone</l>
            <l>Under safe escort, Juan following her:</l>
            <l>The camp—the women, children, and old men—</l>
            <l>Were moving slowly southward on the way</l>
            <l>To Almería. Silva learned no more.</l>
            <l>He marched perforce; what other goal was his</l>
            <l>Than where Fedalma was? And so he marched</l>
            <l>Through the dim passes and o’er rising hills,</l>
            <l>Not knowing whither, till the morning came.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The Moorish hall in the castle at Bedmár. The morn-</l>
            <l>ing twilight dimly shows stains of blood on the </l>
            <l>white marble floor; yet there has been a careful</l>
            <l>restoration of order among the sparse objects of</l>
            <l>furniture. Stretched on mats lie three corpses, the</l>
            <l>faces bare, the bodies covered with mantles. A</l>
            <l>little way off, with rolled matting for a pillow,</l>
            <l>lies ZARCA, sleeping. His chest and arms are</l>
            <l>bare; his weapons, turban, mail-shirt, and other</l>
            <l>upper garments lie on the floor beside him. In</l>
            <l>the outer gallery Zincali are pacing, at intervals,</l>
            <l>past the arched openings.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>ZARCA</speaker> (half rising and resting his elbow on </l>
            <l>the pillow while he looks round).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The morning! I have slept for full three hours;</l>
            <l>Slept without dreams, save of my daughter’s face.</l>
            <l>Its sadness waked me. Soon she will be here,</l>
            <l>Soon must outlive the worse of all the pains</l>
            <l>Bred by false nurture in an alien home—</l>
            <l>As if a lion in fangless infancy</l>
            <l>Learned love of creatures that with fatal growth</l>
            <l>It scents as natural prey, and grasps and tears,</l>
            <l>Yet with heart-hunger yearns for, missing them.</l>
            <l>She is a lioness. And they—the race</l>
            <l>That robbed me of her—reared her to this plain.</l>
            <l>He will be crushed and torn. There was no help.</l>
            <l>But she, my child, will bear it. For strong souls</l>
            <l>Live like fire-hearted suns to spend their strength</l>
            <l>In farthest striving action; breathe more free</l>
            <l>In mighty anguish than in trivial ease.</l>
            <l>Her sad face waked me. I shall meet it soon</l>
            <l>Waking…</l>
            <l>(He rises and stands looking at the corpses.)</l>
            <l>As now I look on these pale dead,</l>
            <l>These blossoming branches crushed beneath the fall</l>
            <l>Of that broad trunk to which I laid my axe</l>
            <l>With fullest foresight. So will I ever face</l>
            <l>In thought beforehand to its utmost reach</l>
            <l>The consequences of my conscious deeds;</l>
            <l>So face them after, bring them to my bed,</l>
            <l>And never drug my soul to sleep with lies.</l>
            <l>If they are cruel, they shall be arraigned</l>
            <l>By that true name; they shall be justified</l>
            <l>By my high purpose, by the clear-seen good</l>
            <l>That grew into my vision as I grew,</l>
            <l>And makes my nature’s function, the full pulse</l>
            <l>Of inbred kingship. Catholics,</l>
            <l>Arabs, and Hebrews, have their god apiece</l>
            <l>To fight and conquer for them, or be bruised,</l>
            <l>Like Allah now, yet keep avenging stores</l>
            <l>Of patient wrath. The Zincali have no god</l>
            <l>Who speaks to them and calls them his, unless</l>
            <l>I, Zarca, carry living in my frame</l>
            <l>The power divine that chooses them and saves.</l>
            <l>“Life and more life unto the chosen, death</l>
            <l>To all things living that would stifle them!”</l>
            <l>So speaks each god that makes a nation strong;</l>
            <l>Burns trees and brutes and slays all hindering men.</l>
            <l>The Spaniards boast their god the strongest now;</l>
            <l>They win most towns by treachery, make most slaves,</l>
            <l>Burn the most vines and men, and rob the most.</l>
            <l>I fight against that strength, and in my turn</l>
            <l>Slay these brave young who duteously strove.</l>
            <l>Cruel? ay, it is cruel. But, how else?</l>
            <l>To save, we kill; each blow we strike at guilt</l>
            <l>Hurts innocence with its shock. Men might well seek</l>
            <l>For purifying rites; even pious deeds</l>
            <l>Need washing. But my cleansing waters flow</l>
            <l>Solely from my intent.</l>
            <l>(He turns away from the bodies to where his </l>
            <l>garments lie, but does not lift them.)</l>
            <l>And she must suffer!</l>
            <l>But she has seen the unchangeable and bowed</l>
            <l>Her head beneath the yoke. And she will walk</l>
            <l>No more in chilling twilight, for to-day</l>
            <l>Rises our sun. The difficult night is past;</l>
            <l>We keep the bridge no more, but cross it; march</l>
            <l>Forth to a land where all our wars shall be</l>
            <l>With greedy obstinate plants that will not yield</l>
            <l>Fruit for their nurture. All our race shall come</l>
            <l>From north, west, east, a kindred multitude,</l>
            <l>And make large fellowship, and raise inspired</l>
            <l>The shout divine, the unison of resolve.</l>
            <l>So I, so she, will see our race redeemed.</l>
            <l>And their keen love of family and tribe</l>
            <l>Shall no more thrive on cunning, hide and lurk</l>
            <l>In petty arts of abject hunted life,</l>
            <l>But grow heroic in the sanctioning light,</l>
            <l>And feed with ardent blood a nation’s heart.</l>
            <l>That is my work: and it is well begun.</l>
            <l>On to achievement!</l>
            <l>(He takes up the mail-shirt, and looks at </l>
            <l>then throws it down again.)</l>
            <l>No, I’ll none of you!</l>
            <l>To-day there’ll be no fighting. A few hours,</l>
            <l>And I shall doff these garments of the Moor:</l>
            <l>Till then I will walk lightly and breathe high.</l>

            <l><speaker>SEPHARDO</speaker> (appearing at the archway leading </l>
            <l>into the outer gallery).</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>You bade me wake you…</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Welcome, Doctor; see,</l>
            <l>With that small task I did but beckon you </l>
            <l>To graver work. You know these corpses?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>SEPHARDO</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes.</l>
            <l>I would they were not corpses. Storms will lay</l>
            <l>The fairest trees and leave the withered stumps.</l>
            <l>This Alvar and the Duke were of one age,</l>
            <l>And very loving friends. I minded not</l>
            <l>The sight of Don Diego’s corpse, for death</l>
            <l>Gave him some gentleness, and had he lived</l>
            <l>I had still hated him. But this young Alvar</l>
            <l>Was doubly noble, as a gem that holds</l>
            <l>Rare virtues in its lustre; and his death</l>
            <l>Will pierce Don Silva with a poisoned dart.</l>
            <l>This fair and curly youth was Arias,</l>
            <l>A son of the Pachecos: this dark face…</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>ZARCA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Enough! you know their names. I had divined</l>
            <l>That they were near the Duke, most like had served</l>
            <l>My daughter, were her friends; so rescued them</l>
            <l>From being flung upon the heap of slain.</l>
            <l>Beseech you, Doctor, if you owe me aught</l>
            <l>As having served your people, take the pains</l>
            <l>To see these bodies buried decently.</l>
            <l>And let their names be writ above their graves,</l>
            <l>As those of brave young Spaniards who died well.</l>
            <l>I needs must bear this womanhood in my heart—</l>
            <l>Bearing my daughter there. For once she prayed—</l>
            <l>‘Twas at our parting—“When you see fair hair</l>
            <l>Be pitiful.” And I am forced to look</l>
            <l>On fair heads living and be pitiless.</l>
            <l>Your service, Doctor, will be done to her.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>A service doubly dear. For these young dead,</l>
            <l>And one less happy Spaniard who still lives,</l>
            <l>Are offering which I wrenched from out my heart,</l>
            <l>Constrained by cries of Israel: while my hands</l>
            <l>Rendered the victims at command, my eyes</l>
            <l>Closed themselves vainly, as if vision lay</l>
            <l>Through those poor loopholes only. I will go</l>
            <l>And see the graves dug by some cypresses.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Meanwhile the bodies shall rest here. Farewell.</l>
            <l>(Exit SEPHARDO.)</l>
            <l>Nay, ‘tis no mockery. She keeps me so </l>
            <l>From hardening with the hardness of my acts.</l>
            <l>This Spaniard shrouded in her love—I would</l>
            <l>He lay here too that I might pity him.</l>

            <l>Morning.—The Plaça Santiago in Bedmár. A crowd</l>
            <l>of townsmen forming an outer circle: within, </l>
            <l>Zincali and Moorish soldiers drawn up round</l>
            <l>the central space. On the higher ground in front</l>
            <l>of the church a stake with faggots heaped, and at</l>
            <l>a little distance a gibbet. Moorish music. ZARCA</l>
            <l>enters, wearing his gold necklace with the Gypsy </l>
            <l>badge of the flaming torch over the dress of a</l>
            <l>Moorish Captain, accompanied by a small band</l>
            <l>of armed Zincali, who fall aside and range them-</l>
            <l>selves with the other soldiers while he takes his</l>
            <l>stand in front of the stake and gibbet. The music</l>
            <l>ceases, and there is expectant silence.</l>

            <l>Men of Bedmár, well-wishers, and allies,</l>
            <l>Whether of Moorish or of Hebrew blood,</l>
            <l>Who, being galled by the hard Spaniard’s yoke,</l>
            <l>Have welcomed our quick conquest as release,</l>
            <l>I, Zarca, chief of Spanish Gypsies, hold</l>
            <l>By delegation of the Moorish King</l>
            <l>Supreme command within this town and fort.</l>
            <l>Nor will I, with false show of modesty,</l>
            <l>Profess myself unworthy of this post,</l>
            <l>For so I should tax the giver’s choice.</l>
            <l>And, as ye know, while I was prisoner here,</l>
            <l>Forging the bullets meant for Moorish hearts,</l>
            <l>But likely now to reach another mark,</l>
            <l>I learned the secrets of the town’s defence,</l>
            <l>Caught the loud whispers of your discontent,</l>
            <l>And so could serve the purpose of the Moor</l>
            <l>As the edge’s keenness serves the weapon’s weight.</l>
            <l>My Zincali, lynx-eyed and lithe of limb,</l>
            <l>Tracked out the high Sierra’s hidden path,</l>
            <l>Guided the hard ascent, and were the first </l>
            <l>To scale the walls and brave the showering stones.</l>
            <l>In brief, I reached this rank through service done</l>
            <l>By thought of mine and valour of my tribe,</l>
            <l>Yet hold it but in trust, with readiness</l>
            <l>To lay it down; for we—the Zincali—</l>
            <l>Will never pitch our tents again on land</l>
            <l>The Spaniard grudges us: we seek a home</l>
            <l>Where we may spread and ripen like the corn</l>
            <l>By blessing of the sun and spacious earth.</l>
            <l>Ye wish us well, I think, and are our friends?</l>

            <l>Now, for the cause of our assembling here.</l>
            <l>‘Twas my command that rescued from your hands </l>
            <l>That Spanish Prior and Inquisitor</l>
            <l>Whom in fierce retribution you had bound</l>
            <l>And meant to burn, tied to a planted cross.</l>
            <l>I rescued him with promise that his death</l>
            <l>Should be more signal in its justice—made</l>
            <l>Public in fullest sense, and orderly.</l>
            <l>Here, then, you see the stake—slow death by fire;</l>
            <l>And there a gibbet—swift death by the cord.</l>
            <l>Now hear me, Moors and Hebrews of Bedmár,</l>
            <l>Our kindred by the warmth of Eastern blood!</l>
            <l>Punishing cruel wrong by cruelty</l>
            <l>We copy Christian crime. Vengeance is just:</l>
            <l>Justly we rid the earth of human fiends</l>
            <l>Who carry hell for pattern in their souls.</l>
            <l>But in high vengeance there is noble scorn:</l>
            <l>It tortures not the torturer, nor gives</l>
            <l>Iniquitous payment for iniquity.</l>
            <l>The great avenging angel does not crawl</l>
            <l>To kill the serpent with a mimic fang;</l>
            <l>He stands erect, with sword of keenest edge</l>
            <l>That slays like lightning. So too we will slay</l>
            <l>The cruel man; slay him because he works</l>
            <l>Woe to mankind. And I have given command</l>
            <l>To pile these faggots, not to burn quick flesh,</l>
            <l>But for a sign of that dire wrong to men</l>
            <l>Which arms our wrath with justice. While, to show</l>
            <l>This Christian worshipper that we obey</l>
            <l>A better law than his, he shall be led</l>
            <l>Straight to the gibbet and to swiftest death.</l>
            <l>For I, the chieftain of the Gypsies, will, </l>
            <l>My people shed no blood but what is shed</l>
            <l>In heat of battle or in judgement strict</l>
            <l>With calm deliberation on the right.</l>
            <l>Such is my will, and if it please you—well.</l>

            <l>Bareheaded now, carrying an unsheathed sword,</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[Zarca waved his arm</l>
            <l>With head averse, in peremptory sign</l>
            <l>That ‘twixt them now there should be space and silence.</l>
            <l>Most eyes had turned to where the prisoner</l>
            <l>Advancing among his guards; and Silva too</l>
            <l>Turned eagerly, all other striving quelled</l>
            <l>By striving with the dread lest he should see</l>
            <l>His thought outside him. And he saw it there.</l>
            <l>The prisoner was Father Isidor:</l>
            <l>The man whom once he fiercely had accused</l>
            <l>As author of his misdeeds—whose designs</l>
            <l>Had forced him into fatal secrecy.</l>
            <l>The imperious and inexorable Will</l>
            <l>Was yoked, and he who had been pitiless</l>
            <l>To Silva’s love, was led to pitiless death.</l>
            <l>O hateful victory of blind wishes—prayers</l>
            <l>Which hell had overheard and swift fulfilled!</l>
            <l>The triumph was a torture, turning all</l>
            <l>The strength of passion into strength of pain.</l>
            <l>Remorse was born within him, that dire birth</l>
            <l>Which robs all else of nurture—cancerous,</l>
            <l>Forcing each pulse to feed its anguish, turning</l>
            <l>All sweetest residues of healthy life</l>
            <l>To fibrous clutches of slow misery.</l>
            <l>Silva had but rebelled—he was not free;</l>
            <l>And all the subtle cords that bound his soul</l>
            <l>Were tightened by the strain of one rash leap</l>
            <l>Made in defiance. He accused no more,</l>
            <l>But dumbly shrank before accusing throngs </l>
            <l>Of thoughts, the impetuous recurrent rush</l>
            <l>Of all his past-created, unchanged self.</l>
            <l>The Father came bareheaded, frocked, a rope</l>
            <l>Around his neck,—but clad with majesty,</l>
            <l>The strength of resolute undivided souls</l>
            <l>Who, owning law, obey it. In his hand</l>
            <l>He bore a crucifix, and praying, gazed</l>
            <l>Solely on that white image. But his guards</l>
            <l>Parted in front, and paused as they approached</l>
            <l>The centre where the stake was. Isidor</l>
            <l>Lifted his eyes to look around him—calm,</l>
            <l>Prepared to speak last words of willingness</l>
            <l>To meet his death—last words of faith unchanged,</l>
            <l>That, working for Christ’s kingdom, he had wrought</l>
            <l>Righteously. But his glance met Silva’s eyes</l>
            <l>And drew him. Even images of stone</l>
            <l>Look living with reproach on him who maims,</l>
            <l>Profanes, defiles them. Silva penitent</l>
            <l>Moved forward, would have knelt before the man</l>
            <l>Who still was one with all the sacred things</l>
            <l>That came back on him in their sacredness,</l>
            <l>Kindred, and oaths, and awe, and mystery.</l>
            <l>But at the sight, the Father thrust the cross</l>
            <l>With deprecating act before him, and his face</l>
            <l>Pale-quivering, flashed out horror like white light</l>
            <l>Flashed from the angel’s sword that dooming drave</l>
            <l>The sinner to the wilderness. He spoke.]</l>

            <l>The form of Father Isidor upswung</l>

            <l>Turned to a symbol of his guilt, and stirred</l>

            <l>Pillowed upon the strength of loving limbs.</l>
            <l>He heaved low groans, but would not spend his breath</l>
            <l>In useless words: he waited till she came,</l>
            <l>Keeping his life within the citadel</l>

            <l>His image gone, there were no wholeness left</l>
            <l>To make a world of for the Zincali’s thought.</l>
            <l>Eager they stood, but hushed; the outer crowd </l>
            <l>Spoke only in low murmurs, and some climbed </l>
            <l>And clung with legs and arms on perilous coigns,</l>
            <l>Striving to see where that colossal life</l>
            <l>Lay panting—lay a Titan struggling still</l>
            <l>To hold and give the precious hidden fire</l>
            <l>Before the stronger grappled him. Above</l>
            <l>The young bright morning cast athwart white</l>
            <l>walls</l>
            <l>Her shadows blue, and with their clear-cut line,</l>
            <l>Mildly relentless as the dial-hands’s,</l>
            <l>Measured the shrinking future of an hour</l>
            <l>Which held a shrinking hope. And all the while</l>
            <l>The silent beat of time in each man’s soul</l>
            <l>Made aching pulses.</l>
            <l>But the cry, “She comes!”</l>
            <l>Parted the crowd like waters: and she came.</l>
            <l>Swiftly as once before, inspired with joy, </l>
            <l>She flashed across the space and made new light,</l>
            <l>Glowing upon the glow of evening,</l>
            <l>So swiftly now she came, inspired with woe,</l>
            <l>Strong with the strength of all her father’s pain,</l>
            <l>Thrilling her as with fire of rage divine</l>
            <l>And battling energy. She knew—saw all:</l>
            <l>The stake with Silva bound—her father pierced—</l>
            <l>To this she had been born: a second time</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>She knelt beside him. Then he raised himself,</l>
            <l>And on her face there flashed from his the light</l>
            <l>As of a star that waned, but flames anew</l>
            <l>In mighty dissolution: ‘twas the flame</l>
            <l>Of a surviving trust, in agony.</l>
            <l>He spoke the parting prayer that was command,</l>
            <l>Must sway her will, and reign invisibly.]</l>

            <l>With multitudinous wave: now rose, now fell,</l>
            <l>Then rose again, the echoes following slow,</l>
            <l>As if the scattered brethren of the tribe</l>

            <l>Then some could hold no longer, but must rush</l>
            <l>To kiss his dying feet, and some to kiss </l>
            <l>The hem of their Queen’s garment. But she raised</l>
            <l>Her hand to hush them. “Hark! your Chief may speak</l>
            <l>Another wish.” Quickly she kneeled again,</l>
            <l>While they upon the ground kept motionless,</l>
            <l>With head outstretched. They heard his words; for</l>
            <l>now,</l>
            <l>Grasping at Nadar’s arm, he spoke more loud,</l>
            <l>As one who, having fought and conquered, hurls</l>

            <l>I charge you let him go unharmed and free</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[With that he sank again—</l>
            <l>His breast heaved strongly tow’rd sharp sudden falls,</l>
            <l>And all his life seemed needed for each breath:</l>

            <l>Be strong…remember…I can only…die.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[His voice went into silence, but his breast</l>
            <l>Heaved long and moaned: its broad strength kept a life</l>
            <l>That heard nought, saw nought, save what once had </l>
            <l>been,</l>
            <l>And what might be in days and realms afar—</l>
            <l>Which now in pale procession faded on</l>
            <l>Toward the thick darkness. And she bent above</l>
            <l>In sacramental watch to see great Death,</l>
            <l>Companion of her future, who would wear</l>
            <l>For ever in her eyes her father’s form.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And yet she knew that hurrying feet had gone</l>
            <l>To do the Chief’s behest, and in her soul</l>
            <l>He who was once its lord was being jarred</l>
            <l>With loosening of cords, that would not loose</l>
            <l>The tightening torture of his anguish. This—</l>
            <l>Oh, she knew it!—knew it as martyrs knew</l>
            <l>The prongs that tore their flesh, while yet their tongues</l>
            <l>Refused the ease of lies. In moments high</l>
            <l>Space widens in the soul. And so she knelt,</l>
            <l>Clinging with piety and awed resolve</l>
            <l>Beside this altar of her father’s life,</l>
            <l>Seeing long travel under solemn suns</l>
            <l>Stretching beyond it; never turned her eyes,</l>
            <l>Yet felt that Silva passed; beheld his face</l>
            <l>Pale, vivid, all alone, imploring her</l>
            <l>Across black waters fathomless.</l>
            <l>And he passed.</l>
            <l>The Gypsies made wide pathway, shrank aloof</l>
            <l>As those who fear to touch the thing they hate,</l>
            <l>Lest hate triumphant, mastering all the limbs,</l>
            <l>Should tear, bite, crush, in spite of hindering will.</l>
            <l>Slowly he walked, reluctant to be safe</l>
            <l>And bear dishonoured life which none assailed.</l>
            <l>Walked hesitatingly, all his frame instinct</l>
            <l>With high-born spirit, never used to dread</l>
            <l>Or crouch for smiles, yet stung, yet quivering</l>
            <l>With helpless strength, and in his soul convulsed</l>
            <l>By visions where pale horror held a lamp</l>
            <l>Over wide-reaching crime. Silence hung round:</l>
            <l>It seemed the Plaça hushed itself to hear</l>
            <l>His footsteps and the Chief’s deep dying breath.</l>
            <l>Eyes quickened in the stillness, and the light</l>
            <l>Seemed one clear gaze upon his misery.</l>
            <l>And yet he could not pass her without pause:</l>
            <l>One instant he must pause and look at her;</l>
            <l>But with that glance at her averted head,</l>
            <l>New-urged by pain he turned away and went,</l>
            <l>Carrying for ever with him what he fled—</l>
            <l>Her murdered love—her love, a dear wronged ghost,</l>
            <l>Facing him, beauteous, ‘mid the throngs of hell.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>O fallen and forsaken! were no hearts </l>
            <l>Amid that crowd, mindful of what had been?—</l>
            <l>Hearts such as wait on beggared royalty,</l>
            <l>Or silent watch by sinners who despair?</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Silva had vanished. That dismissed revenge</l>
            <l>Made larger room for sorrow in fierce hearts;</l>
            <l>And sorrow filled them. For the Chief was dead.</l>
            <l>The mighty breast subsided slow to calm,</l>
            <l>Slow from the face the ethereal spirit waned,</l>
            <l>As wanes the parting glory from the heights,</l>
            <l>And leaves them in their pallid majesty.</l>
            <l>Fedalma kissed the marble lips, and said,</l>
            <l>“He breathes no more.” And then a long loud wail, </l>
            <l>Poured out upon the morning, made her light</l>
            <l>Ghastly as smiles on some fair maniac’s face</l>
            <l>Smiling unconscious o’er her bridegroom’s corse.</l>
            <l>The wailing men in eager press closed round,</l>
            <l>And made a shadowing pall beneath the sun.</l>
            <l>They lifted reverent the prostrate strength,</l>
            <l>Sceptred anew by death. Fedalma walked</l>
            <l>Tearless, erect, following the dead—her cries</l>
            <l>Deep smothering in her breast, as one who guides</l>
            <l>Her children through the wilds, and sees and knows</l>
            <l>Of danger more than they, and feels more pangs,</l>
            <l>Yet shrinks not, groans not, bearing in her heart</l>

            <l>The eastward rocks of Almería’s bay</l>
            <l>Answer long farewells of the travelling sun</l>
            <l>With softest glow as from an inward pulse</l>
            <l>Changing and flushing: all the Moorish ships</l>
            <l>Seem conscious too, and shoot out sudden shadows;</l>
            <l>Their black hulls snatch a glory, and their sails</l>
            <l>Show variegated radiance, gently stirred</l>
            <l>Like broad wings poised. Two galleys moored apart</l>
            <l>Show decks as busy as a home of ants</l>
            <l>Storing new forage; from their sides the boats,</l>
            <l>Slowly pushed off, anon with flashing oar</l>
            <l>Make transit to the quay’s smooth-quarried edge,</l>
            <l>Where thronging Gypsies are in haste to lade</l>
            <l>Each as it comes with grandames, babes, and wives,</l>
            <l>Or with dust-tinted goods, the company</l>
            <l>Of wandering years. Nought seems to lie unmoved,</l>
            <l>For ‘mid the throng the lights and shadows play,</l>
            <l>And make all surface eager, while the boats</l>
            <l>Sway restless as a horse that heard the shouts</l>
            <l>And surging hum incessant. Naked limbs</l>
            <l>With beauteous ease bend, lift and throw, or raise</l>
            <l>High signalling hands. The black-haired mother steps</l>
            <l>Athwart the boat’s edge, and with opened arms,</l>
            <l>A wandering Isis outcast from the gods,</l>
            <l>Leans towards her lifted little one. The boat </l>
            <l>Full-laden cuts the waves, and dirge-like cries</l>
            <l>Rise and then fall within it as it moves</l>
            <l>From high to lower and from bright to dark.</l>
            <l>Hither and thither, grave white-turbaned Moors</l>
            <l>Move helpfully, and some bring welcome gifts,</l>
            <l>Bright stuffs and cutlery, and bags of seed</l>
            <l>To make new waving crops in Africa.</l>
            <l>Others aloof with folded arms slow-eyed</l>
            <l>Survey man’s labour, saying, “God is great;”</l>
            <l>Or seek with question deep the Gypsies’ root,</l>
            <l>And whether their false faith, being small, will prove</l>
            <l>Less damning than the copious false creeds</l>
            <l>Oh Jews and Christians: Moslem subtlety </l>
            <l>Found balanced reasons, warranting suspense</l>
            <l>As to whose hell was deepest—‘twas enough</l>
            <l>That there was room for all. Thus the sedate.</l>
            <l>The younger heads were busy with the tale</l>
            <l>Of that great Chief whose exploits helped the Moor.</l>
            <l>And, talking still, they shouldered past their friends</l>
            <l>Following some lure which held their distant gaze</l>
            <l>To eastward of the quay, where yet remained</l>
            <l>A low black tent close guarded all around</l>
            <l>By well-armed Gypsies. Fronting it above,</l>
            <l>Raised by stone steps that sought a jutting strand,</l>
            <l>Fedalma stood and marked with anxious watch</l>
            <l>Each laden boat the remnant lessening</l>
            <l>Of cargo on the shore, or traced the course</l>
            <l>Of Nadar to and fro in hard command</l>
            <l>Of noisy tumult; imaging oft anew</l>
            <l>How much of labour still deferred the hour</l>
            <l>When they must lift the boat and bear away</l>
            <l>Her father’s coffin, and her feet must quit</l>
            <l>This shore for ever. Motionless she stood,</l>
            <l>Black-crowned with wreaths of many-shadowed hair;</l>
            <l>Black-robed, but bearing wide upon her breast </l>
            <l>Her father’s golden necklace and his badge. </l>
            <l>Her limbs were motionless, but in her eyes</l>
            <l>And in her breathing lip’s soft tremulous curve</l>
            <l>Was intense motion as of prisoned fire</l>
            <l>Escaping subtly in outleaping thought.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>She watches anxiously, and yet she dreams:</l>
            <l>The busy moments now expand, now shrink</l>
            <l>To narrowing swarms within the refluent space</l>
            <l>Of changeful consciousness. For in her thought</l>
            <l>Already she has left the fading shore,</l>
            <l>Sails with her people, seeks an unknown land,</l>
            <l>And bears the burning length of weary days</l>
            <l>That parching fall upon her father’s hope,</l>
            <l>Which she must plant and see it wither only—</l>
            <l>Wither and die. She saw the end begun.</l>
            <l>The Gypsy hearts were not unfaithful: she</l>
            <l>Was centre to the savage loyalty</l>
            <l>Which vowed obedience to Zarca dead.</l>
            <l>But soon their natures missed the constant stress</l>
            <l>Of his command, that, while it fired, restrained</l>
            <l>By urgency supreme, and left no play</l>
            <l>To fickle impulse scattering desire.</l>
            <l>They loved their Queen, trusted in Zarca’s child,</l>
            <l>Would bear her o’er the desert on their arms </l>
            <l>And think the weight a gladsome victory;</l>
            <l>But that great force which knit them into one,</l>
            <l>The invisible passion of her father’s soul,</l>
            <l>That wrought them visibly into its will, </l>
            <l>And would have bound their lives with permanence,</l>
            <l>Was gone. Already Hassan and two bands,</l>
            <l>Drawn by fresh baits of gain, had newly sold</l>
            <l>Their service to the Moors, despite her call,</l>
            <l>Known as the echo of her father’s will, </l>
            <l>To all the tribe, that they should pass with her</l>
            <l>Straightway to Telemsán. They were not moved </l>
            <l>By worse rebellion than the wilful wish</l>
            <l>To fashion their own service; they still meant</l>
            <l>To come when it should suit them. But she said,</l>
            <l>This is the cloud no bigger than a hand,</l>
            <l>Sure-threatening. In a little while, the tribe</l>
            <l>That was to be the ensign of the race,</l>
            <l>And draw it into conscious union, </l>
            <l>Itself would break in small and scattered bands</l>
            <l>That, living on scant prey, would still disperse</l>
            <l>And propagate forgetfulness. Brief years,</l>
            <l>And that great purpose fed with vital fire</l>
            <l>That might have glowed for half a century,</l>
            <l>Subduing, quickening, shaping, like a sun—</l>
            <l>Would be a faint tradition, flickering low</l>
            <l>In dying memories, fringing with dim light</l>
            <l>The nearer dark.</l>
            <l>Far, far the future stretched</l>
            <l>Beyond that busy present on the quay,</l>
            <l>Far her straight path beyond it. Yet she watched</l>
            <l>To mark the growing hour, and yet in dream</l>
            <l>Alternate she beheld another track,</l>
            <l>And felt herself unseen pursuing it</l>
            <l>Close to a wanderer, who with haggard gaze</l>
            <l>Looked out on loneliness. The backward years—</l>
            <l>Oh, she would not forget them—would not drink</l>
            <l>Of waters that brought rest, while he far off </l>
            <l>Remembered. “Father, I renounced the joy;</l>
            <l>You must forgive the sorrow.”</l>
            <l>So she stood,</l>
            <l>Her struggling life compressed into that hour,</l>
            <l>Yearning, resolving, conquering; though she seemed</l>
            <l>Still as a tutelary image sent</l>
            <l>To guard her people and to be the strength</l>
            <l>Of some rock-citadel.</l>
            <l>Below her sat</l>
            <l>Slim mischievous Hinda, happy, red-bedecked</l>
            <l>With rows of berries, grinning, nodding oft,</l>
            <l>And shaking high her small dark arm and hand</l>
            <l>Responsive to the black-maned Ismaël,</l>
            <l>Who held aloft his spoil, and clad in skins</l>
            <l>Seemed the Boy-prophet of the wilderness</l>
            <l>Escaped from tasks prophetic. But anon</l>
            <l>Hinda would backward turn upon her knees,</l>
            <l>And like a pretty loving hound would bend</l>
            <l>To fondle her Queen’s feet, then lift her head</l>
            <l>Hoping to feel the gently pressing palm</l>
            <l>Which touched the deeper sense. Fedalma knew—</l>
            <l>From out the black robe stretched her speaking hand</l>
            <l>And shared the girl’s content.</l>
            <l>So the dire hours</l>
            <l>Burthened with destiny—the death of hopes</l>
            <l>Darkening long generations, or the birth</l>
            <l>Of thoughts undying—such hours sweep along</l>
            <l>In their aerial ocean measureless </l>
            <l>Myriads of little joys, that ripen sweet </l>
            <l>And soothe the sorrowful spirit of the world,</l>
            <l>Groaning and travailing with the painful birth</l>
            <l>Of slow redemption.</l>
            <l>But emerging now</l>
            <l>From eastward fringing lines of idling men</l>
            <l>Quick Juan lightly sought the upward steps</l>
            <l>Behind Fedalma, and two paces off, </l>
            <l>With head uncovered, said in gentle tones,</l>
            <l>“Lady Fedalma!”—(Juan’s password now</l>
            <l>Used by no other), and Fedalma turned,</l>
            <l>Knowing who sought her. He advanced a step,</l>
            <l>And meeting straight her large calm questioning gaze,</l>
            <l>Warned her of some grave purport by a face</l>
            <l>That told of trouble. Lower still he spoke.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Look from me, lady, towards a moving form</l>
            <l>That quits the crows and seeks the lonelier strand—</l>
            <l>A tall and grey-clad pilgrim….</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[Solemnly</l>
            <l>His low tones fell on her, as if she passed</l>
            <l>Into religious dimness among tombs,</l>
            <l>And trod on names in everlasting rest.</l>
            <l>Lingeringly she looked, and then with voice</l>
            <l>Deep and yet soft, like notes from some long chord</l>
            <l>Responsive to thrilled air, said—]</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>FEDALMA</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>It is he!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[Juan kept silence for a little space,</l>
            <l>With reverent caution, lest his lighter grief</l>
            <l>Might seem a wanton touch upon her pain.</l>
            <l>But time was urging him with visible flight,</l>
            <l>Changing the shadows: he must utter all.]</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>That man was young when last I pressed his hand—</l>
            <l>In that dread moment when he left Bedmár.</l>
            <l>He has aged since: the week has made him grey.</l>
            <l>And yet I knew him—knew the white-streaked hair</l>
            <l>Before I saw his face, as I should know</l>
            <l>The tear-dimmed writing of a friend. See now—</l>
            <l>Does he not linger—pause?—perhaps expect…</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[Juan pled timidly: Fedalma’s eyes</l>
            <l>Flashed; and through all her frame there ran the shock</l>
            <l>Of some sharp-wounding joy, like his who hastes</l>
            <l>And dreads to come too late, and comes in time</l>
            <l>To press a loved hand dying. She was mute</l>
            <l>And made no gesture: all her being paused </l>
            <l>In resolution, as some leonine wave</l>
            <l>That makes a moment’s silence ere it leaps.]</l>
          </lg>

            <l><speaker>JUAN</speaker>.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>He came from Carthagena, in a boat</l>
            <l>Too slight for safety; yon small two-oared boat</l>
            <l>Below the rock; the fisher-boy within</l>
            <l>Awaits his signal. But the pilgrim waits….</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, I will go!—Father, I owe him this,</l>
            <l>For loving me made all his misery.</l>
            <l>And we will look once more—will say farewell</l>
            <l>As in a solemn rite to strengthen us</l>
            <l>For our eternal parting. Juan, stay</l>
            <l>Here in my place, to warn me, were there need.</l>
            <l>And, Hinda, follow me!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>[All men who watched</l>
            <l>Lost her regretfully, then drew content</l>
            <l>From thought that she must quickly come again</l>
            <l>And filled the time with striving to be near.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>She, down the steps, along the sandy brink</l>
            <l>To where he stood, walked firm; with quickened step</l>
            <l>The moment when each felt the other saw.</l>
            <l>He moved at sight of her: their glances met;</l>
            <l>It seemed they could no more remain aloof</l>
            <l>Than nearing waters hurrying into one.</l>
            <l>Yet their steps slackened and they paused apart,</l>
            <l>Pressed backward by the force of memories</l>
            <l>Which reigned supreme as death above desire.</l>
            <l>Two paces off they stood and silently</l>
            <l>Looked at each other. Was it well to speak?</l>
            <l>Could speech be clearer, stronger, tell them more</l>
            <l>Than that long gaze of their renouncing love?</l>
            <l>They passed from silence hardly knowing how;</l>
            <l>It seemed they heard each other’s thought before.]</l>

            <l>Vengeance! She does but sweep us with her skirts—</l>
            <l>She takes large space, and lies a baleful light</l>
            <l>Revolving with long years—sees children’s children,</l>
            <l>Blights them in their prime….Oh, if two lovers leaned</l>
            <l>To breathe one air and spread a pestilence,</l>
            <l>They would but lie two livid victims dead</l>
            <l>Amid the city of the dying. We</l>

            <l>No dread, but clear assurance of the end.</l>
            <l>My father held within his mighty frame</l>

          <lg>
            <l>I go to Rome, to seek</l>
            <l>The right to use my knightly sword again;</l>
            <l>The right to fill my place and live or die</l>
            <l>So that all Spaniards shall not curse my name.</l>
            <l>I sate one hour upon the barren rock</l>
            <l>And longed to kill myself; but then I said,</l>
            <l>I will not leave my name in infamy,</l>
            <l>I will not be perpetual rottenness</l>
            <l>Upon the Spaniard’s air. If I must sink</l>
            <l>At last to hell, I will not take my stand</l>
            <l>Among the coward crew who could not bear</l>
            <l>The harm themselves had done, which others bore.</l>
            <l>My young life yet may fill some fatal breach,</l>
            <l>And I will take no pardon, not my own,</l>
            <l>Not God’s—no pardon idly on my knees:</l>
            <l>But it shall come to me upon my feet</l>
            <l>And in the thick of action, and each deed</l>
            <l>That carried shame and wrong shall be the sting</l>
            <l>That drives me higher up the steep of honour</l>
            <l>In deeds of duteous service to that Spain</l>
            <l>Who nourished me on her expectant breast,</l>
            <l>The heir of highest gifts. I will not fling</l>
            <l>My earthly being down for carrion</l>
            <l>To fill the air with loathing: I will be</l>
            <l>The living prey of some fierce noble death</l>
            <l>That leaps upon me while I move. Aloud</l>
            <l>I said, “I will redeem my name,” and then—</l>
            <l>I know not if aloud: I felt the words</l>
            <l>Drinking up all my senses—“She still lives.</l>
            <l>I would not quit the dear familiar earth</l>
            <l>Where both of us behold the self-same sun,</l>
            <l>Where there can be no strangeness ‘twixt our thoughts</l>
            <l>So deep as their communion.” Resolute</l>
            <l>I rose and walked.—Fedalma, think of me</l>
            <l>As one who will regain the only life</l>
            <l>Where he is other than apostate—one</l>
            <l>Who seeks but to renew and keep the vows</l>
            <l>Of Spanish knight and noble. But the breach</l>
            <l>Outside those vows—the fatal second breach—</l>
            <l>Lies a dark gulf where I have nought to cast,</l>
            <l>Not even expiation—poor pretence,</l>
            <l>Which changes nought but what survives the past,</l>
            <l>And raises not the dead. That deep dark gulf</l>
            <l>Divides us.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Yes, for ever. We must walk</l>
            <l>Apart unto the end. Our marriage rite</l>
            <l>Is our resolve that we will each be true</l>
            <l>To high allegiance, higher than our love.</l>
            <l>Our dear young love—its breath was happiness!</l>
            <l>But it has grown upon a larger life</l>
            <l>Which tore its roots asunder. We rebelled—</l>
            <l>The larger life subdued us. Yet we are wed;</l>
            <l>For we shall carry each the pressure deep</l>
            <l>Of the other’s soul. I soon shall leave the shore.</l>
            <l>The winds to-night will bear me far away.</l>
            <l>My lord, farewell!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>He did not say “Farewell.”</l>
            <l>But neither knew that he was silent. She,</l>
            <l>For one long moment, moved not. They knew nought</l>
            <l>Save that they parted; for their mutual gaze</l>
            <l>As with their soul’s full speech forbade their hands</l>
            <l>To seek each other—those oft-clasping hands</l>
            <l>Which had a memory of their own, and went</l>
            <l>Widowed of one dear touch for evermore.</l>
            <l>At last she turned and with swift movement passed,</l>
            <l>Beckoning to Hinda, who was bending low</l>
            <l>And lingered still to wash her shells, but soon</l>
            <l>Leaping and scampering followed, while her Queen</l>
            <l>Mounted the steps again and took her place,</l>
            <l>Which Juan rendered silently.</l>
            <l>And now</l>
            <l>The press upon the quay was thinned; the ground</l>
            <l>Was cleared of cumbering heaps, the eager shouts</l>
            <l>Had sunk, and left a murmur more restrained</l>
            <l>By common purpose. All the men ashore</l>
            <l>Were gathering into ordered companies,</l>
            <l>And with less clamour filled the waiting boats,</l>
            <l>As if the speaking light commanded them</l>
            <l>To quiet speed: for now the farewell glow</l>
            <l>Was on the topmost heights, and where far ships</l>
            <l>Were southward tending, tranquil, slow, and white</l>
            <l>Upon the luminous meadow toward the verge.</l>
            <l>The quay was still in shadow, and the boats</l>
            <l>Went sombrely upon the sombre waves.</l>
            <l>Fedalma watched again; but now her gaze</l>
            <l>Takes in the eastward bay, where that small bark </l>
            <l>Which held the fisher-boy floats weightier</l>
            <l>With one more life, that rests upon the oar</l>
            <l>Watching with her. He would not go away</l>
            <l>Till she was gone; he would not turn his face</l>
            <l>Away from her at parting: but the sea</l>
            <l>Should widen slowly ‘twixt their seeking eyes. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The time was coming. Nadar had approached.</l>
            <l>Was the Queen ready? Would she follow now</l>
            <l>Her father’s body? For the largest boat</l>
            <l>Was waiting at the quay, the last strong band</l>
            <l>Of Zincali had ranged themselves in lines</l>
            <l>To guard her passage and to follow her.</l>
            <l>“Yes, I am ready;” and with action prompt</l>
            <l>They cast aside the Gypsy’s wandering tomb,</l>
            <l>And fenced the space from curious Moors who pressed</l>
            <l>To see Chief Zarca’s coffin as it lay.</l>
            <l>They raised it slowly, holding it aloft</l>
            <l>On shoulders proud to bear the heavy load.</l>
            <l>Bound on the coffin lay the chieftain’s arms,</l>
            <l>His Gypsy garments and his coat of mail.</l>
            <l>Fedalma saw the burthen lifted high,</l>
            <l>And then descending followed. All was still.</l>
            <l>The Moors aloof could hear the struggling steps</l>
            <l>Beneath the lowered burthen at the boat—</l>
            <l>The struggling calls subdued, till safe released</l>
            <l>It lay within, the space around it filled</l>
            <l>By black-haired Gypsies. Then Fedalma stepped</l>
            <l>From off the shore and saw it flee away—</l>
            <l>The land that bred her helping the resolve</l>
            <l>Which exiled her for ever. </l>
            <l>It was night</l>
            <l>Before the ships weighed anchor and gave sail:</l>
            <l>Fresh Night emergent in her clearness, lit</l>
            <l>By the large crescent moon, with Hesperus,</l>
            <l>And those great stars that lead the eager host.</l>
            <l>Fedalma stood and watched the little bark</l>
            <l>Lying jet-black upon moon-whitened waves.</l>
            <l>Silva was standing too. He too divined</l>
            <l>A steadfast form that held him with its thought,</l>
            <l>And eyes that sought him vanishing: he saw</l>
            <l>The waters widen slowly, till at last</l>
            <l>Straining he gazed, and knew not if he gazed</l>
            <l>On aught but blackness overhung by stars.</l>

            <l>The Indian fig (Opuntia), like the other Cactaceae, is</l>

          <lg>
            <l>The name given by the Spanish Jews to the multitudes</l>
            <l>of their race converted to Christianity at the end of the</l>
            <l>fourteenth century and beginning of the fifteenth. The</l>
            <l>lofty derivation from Maran-atha, the Lord cometh,</l>
            <l>seems hardly called for, seeing that Marrano is Spanish </l>
            <l>for pig. The “old Christians” learned to use the word</l>
            <l>as a term of contempt for the “new Christians,” or the con-</l>
            <l>verted Jews and their descendants; but not too monot-</l>
            <l>onously, for they often interchanged it with the fine old</l>
            <l>crusted opprobrium of the name Jew. Still, many Mar-</l>
            <l>ranos held the highest secular and ecclesiastical prizes in</l>
            <l>Spain, and were respected accordingly.</l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>The Spaniards conceived their patron Santiago (St</l>
            <l>James), the great captain of their armies, as a knight</l>
            <l>and baron: to them, the incongruity would have lain in</l>
            <l>conceiving him simply as a Galilean fisherman. And</l>
            <l>their legend was adopted with respect by devout medi-</l>
            <l>aeval minds generally. Dante, in an elevated passage of</l>
            <l>the Paradiso—the memorable opening of Canto XXV.—</l>
            <l>chooses to introduce the Apostle James as il barone.</l>
            <l>“Indi si mosse un lume verso noi</l>
            <l>Di quella schiera, ond ‘uscì la primizia</l>
            <l>Che lasciò Cristo de’ vicari suoi.</l>
            <l>E la mia Donna piena de Letizia</l>

            <l>P. 223. The Seven Parts.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Las Siete Partitas (The Seven Parts) is the title given</l>
            <l>to the code of laws compiled under Alfonso the Tenth,</l>
            <l>who reigned in the latter half of the thirteenth century </l>
            <l>--1252-1284. The passage in the text is translated from</l>
            <l>Partida II., Ley II. The whole preamble is worth citing</l>
            <l>in its old Spanish:—</l>
            <l>“Como deben ser escogidos los caballeros.”</l>
            <l>“Antiguamiente para facer cabelleros escogien de los</l>
            <l>venadores de monte, que son homes que sufren grande</l>
            <l>laceria, et carpinteros, et ferreros, et pedreros, porque</l>
            <l>usan mucho a ferir et son fuerte de manos; et ostrosi de</l>
            <l>los carniceros, por razon que usan matar las cosas vivas</l>
            <l>et esparcer la sangre dellas: et aun cataban otra cosa en</l>
            <l>escogiendolos que fuesen bien faccionadas de membros</l>
            <l>para ser recios, et Fuertes et ligeros. Et esta Menara de</l>
            <l>escoger usaron los antiguos muy grant tiempo; mas</l>
            <l>porque despues vieron muchas vegadas que estos atales</l>
            <l>non habiendo vergüenza olvidaban todas estas cosas</l>
            <l>sobredichas, et en logar de vincer sus enemigos vencí-</l>
            <l>ense ellos, tovieron por bien los sabidores destas cosas</l>
            <l>que catasen homes para esto que hobiesen naturalmiente</l>

            <l>otras cosas cataron que fuesen homes porque se guarda-</l>
            <l>sen de facer cosa por que podiesen caer en vergüenza:</l>
            <l>et porque estos fueron escogidos de buenos logares et</l>
            <l>algo, que quiere tanto decir en language de España como</l>
            <l>bien, pore so los llamaron fijosdalgo, que muestra atanto</l>
            <l>como fijos de bien. Et en algunos otros logares los</l>
            <l>llamaron gentiles, et tomaron este nombre de gentileza</l>
            <l>que muestra atanto como nobleza de bondat, porque los</l>
            <l>gentiles fueron nobles homes et buenos, et vevieron mas</l>
            <l>ordenadamente que las otras gentes. Et esta gentileza</l>
            <l>aviene en tres maneras; la una por linage, la segunda</l>
            <l>por saber, et la tercera por bondat de armas et de cos-</l>
            <l>tumbres et de maneras. Et comoquier que estos que la</l>
            <l>ganan por su sabidoría ó por su bondat, son con derecho</l>
            <l>llamados nobles et gentiles, mayormiente lo son aquellos</l>
            <l>que la han por linage antiguimiente, et facen Buena vida</l>
            <l>porque les viene de lueñe como por heredat: et por ende</l>
            <l>son mas encargados de facer bien et guardarse de yerro</l>
            <l>et de malestanza; ca non tan solamiente quando lo facen</l>
            <l>resciben daño et vergüenza ellos mismos, ma aun aquellos</l>
            <l>onde ellos vienen.”</l>
